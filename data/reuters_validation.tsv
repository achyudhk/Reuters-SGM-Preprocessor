The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would "distort, not support" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the "must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact, which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or selling operations, were carried forward from the previous agreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is "meant to support the market where trade buying is not." In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced "posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

A high-level meeting last week which included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior USDA officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told Reuters. "We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close the door on anything," a member of the soybean delegation said. At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn. But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers. Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but participants would not reveal what those options were. "There were no surprises in our package," one participant said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates. The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash. This would have the effect of lowering the world price, maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government's soybean inventory. A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last week's meeting, participants said. One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a "listening session" for USDA, and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department. USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future. "USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could influence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal," a participant said. Reuter 

India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. "We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said.

China has closed the second round of bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights, the China Daily has reported. It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15 foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km. Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day. The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies. The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round. China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37 companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were terminated after no oil was discovered. Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore China since 1979. REUTER 

China has raised the prices it pays farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said. The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He gave no details of the price increases. On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of purchasing through agents. He said the state will increase investment in agriculture and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices. The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a low state-fixed price. He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year and an actual 391 mln last year. He gave no more details. REUTER 

He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal approaches about a takeover of the group but was not interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not elaborate. Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc <DIST.L> in the first half of last year. The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price during the bid. Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness affair. Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier, resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider information. He currently faces criminal charges. Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the most traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff had been supportive. "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet." Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from corporate finance activities and progress in asset management. Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable touch of the budget." Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a new chief executive within a few months. He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of 562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said. Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on yesterday's 375p. REUTER... 

Shifts from mild to very cold weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said. In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year. He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north. Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added. The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley. Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields. The officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added. Reuter 

Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, <Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said. The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals. "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said. The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets. Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities. "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said. Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges. But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said. He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region." In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery. Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets. He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments. Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies. Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia. But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978. While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said. REUTER 

The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this "extensification" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition." EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed. Reuter 

The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said. Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index. While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates. But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday. The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse. "On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses," Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said. He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies. However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency. Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said. Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week's budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters. Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K. Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound. In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted. U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling. Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis. Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point. Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling. Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current account figures for February. Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January's small surplus. REUTER 

Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its board of directors seeking to invalidate its "poison pill" anti-takeover plan. TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its 52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc <PIE>. Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more expensive. USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont. USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no comment on TWA's lawsuit. USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending approval of a takeover. USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large." USAir called on the transportation department to reject TWA's request. Reuter 

Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day. Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity, he said. The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs. Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily. Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities, set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity. The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets. Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth. "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said. "It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy." "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added. The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates. But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive. The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago. To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices. Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can. Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard. The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct. Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months. The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher. A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates. REUTER 

Most Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels, industry sources said. They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs. Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said. The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd. They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices. "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price," one Japanese refiner said. "We don't intend to put pressure on them," he added. Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower, oil traders said. They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices. Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus. The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the fixed prices. But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter. They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend. One Japanese refiner said, "At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their ability." Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, "Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices." He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude. A Japanese refiner said, "The European and U.S. Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky." 

Beaver Creek State Bank in Beaver Creek, Minn., failed and the bank's insured assets were transferred to Citizens State Bank of Silver Lake, Minn., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Separately, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Victor Federal Savings and Loan Association of Muskogee, Okla., was placed into receivership. Beaver Creek's two offices will re-open as branches of Citizens on Monday. The transfer was arranged because there were no bids to buy Beaver Creek, the FDIC said. Citizens will pay a premium of 30,000 dlrs to the FDIC and purchase Beaver Creek's assets for 5.3 mln dlrs. It was the 43rd bank failure in the nation this year. The FHLBB said Victor Federal Savings was insolvent and its assets were transferred to a newly chartered federal mutual association with directors named by the FHLBB. Victor was a stock association with 564 mln dlrs in assets.

Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a ministry spokesman said. The measure was published today in the Official State Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days. The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public interest." Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year. Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation. REUTER 

Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years, partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate, the Nomura research institute said. Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in the year, which starts April 1, the research arm of Nomura Securities Co said in a statement. Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct. The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year. Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, such as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.

The company said the flat results will be due to higher than normal expenditures during the fourth quarter for expansion of its data processing capabilities. Earlier, Metromail reported fiscal 1987 third quarter earnings of 2.4 mln dlrs, or 25 cts a share, versus three mln dlrs, or 32 cts a share, the prior third quarter, and nine months net of 7.2 mln dlrs, or 76 cts a share, versus 7.8 mln dlrs, or 82 cts a share the prior nine months.

Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match <SMBS ST>, one of the companies at the core of their business empire. A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match. Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier <NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said. Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares. The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match. The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company. The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators. The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo <VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco <ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs <SKPS ST>. Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB <SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them. Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB <ALFS ST>. During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire. But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB <ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

A Portuguese court has made a preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers, grain traders and officials said. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community, EC, a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders. Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders. Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings. A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn. Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly. It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders. Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue. "They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile," one trader said. ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary. Reuter 

Representatives of the International Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between industry and the LME. In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which will retain the prompt date settlement basis. Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change (the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental change in the function of the LME and in its service to the industry, the release said. By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from non-trade orientated markets such as Comex. The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry delegates said. The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week. A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of review and change, the press release said.

Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar. Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea. "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community," Yeutter said. For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country. He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in two or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan." Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable. "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeutter said. Reuter 

Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company. Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said. Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is support for his offer. Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock. Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders. Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and appropriate at this time." "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch. Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try. Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family. Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch. American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out. An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10. Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical. The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch. Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition. Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal. Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group. "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment," Pesch said. Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place. He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals. Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical. Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share. Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year. Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously. But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. "I think it's much more doable," he said. Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs. Reuter 

A government study has concluded the U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability, the New York Times said. The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil. The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo. The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from 27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said. It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels. The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day, rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget. The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers. "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added. The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S. Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced.

The Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Suggested that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone make efforts to present "advanced' proposals on trade issues when he visits Washington next month. Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone, Kyodo News Service said. Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss U.S.-Japan economic issues. Matsunaga cited issues such as a U.S.-Japan micro chip trade pact, foreign access to the Kansai international airport project, and a new international telecommunications firm. Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent U.S. Developments over trade, in preparation for Nakasone's visit to Washington, April 29 to May 5. Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy, "I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended." Nakasone did not elaborate. The U.S.-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the U.S. Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact. Meanwhile, Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market, such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project, party sources said. The LDP international economic affairs council was responding to Nakasone's request for measures to reduce Japan's increasing trade surpluses with the U.S. And Europe, they said. REUTER 

Davy McKee Ltd, a subsidiary of U.K. Engineering and contruction company Davy Corp Plc, has been awarded a contract worth around 15 mln stg for the design of a zinc and lead smelter in India, a spokesman for the company said. The contract is being funded by Britain's Overseas Development Administration as part of a total grant of 73.65 mln stg to India's state-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd. The grant is for the development of a major zinc and lead mine and associated smelting complex in Rajastan, North West India, the agency said. The agency said the project was expected to account for 44 pct of India's total production of zinc. A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply of goods and services from Britain. The grant comes as part of package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development. The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India's coal sector, for the expansion of its indigenous coal development programme, using British-designed longwall technology. Reuter 

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States, political analysts said. Nakasone, already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan, may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), they said. "The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base," Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters. "So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone." Even before the latest trade friction flared, Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax. "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone," Uchida said. "His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today." Nakasone, who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members, is now seeing his public support eroded, the analysts said. The yen's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition, the analysts said. "Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively," Rei Shiratori, director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan, said. This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility, Shiratori told Reuters. The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue, the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections, analysts said. "If the elections go against the LDP, Nakasone may have to resign early," Shiratori said. But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29, some analysts said. However, "unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues, he will face a very hostile audience," said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling. "If the trip is a major disaster, it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin," he said. Reagan's own weakened domestic position, and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan, argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute, the analysts said. But a desire on both sides to find some solution, coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone, could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone, they said. "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave," Sterling said. REUTER 

The state-owned Krung Thai Bank Ltd will start taking over state-owned Sayam Bank Ltd and complete the process in a year, Finance Minister Suthee Singhasaneh told a press conference. He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem the current heavy losses of Sayam and to avoid competition between the two state-owned institutions. The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts, while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's name. Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd. Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At the end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, was ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks.

"No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas, floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a paper institute conference in New York today. DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects. DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said. "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said. Reuter 

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she and Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov had set targets for increased trade between the two countries during talks earlier today. She said she hoped more economic exchanges between Britain and the Soviet Union "will also lead to increased friendship and increased understanding." Earlier, she told a meeting of Soviet and British businessmen that she had agreed with Ryzhkov that they would work to achieve a total volume of 2.5 billion roubles in bilateral trade by 1990. This would entail an increase by each side of 350 to 400 mln stg over their present export levels. "Mr Ryzhkov handed me a list of import and export opportunities which I hope you will all jump at," she told the meeting to mark the opening of new offices of the British- Soviet Chamber of Commerce. After her talks with Ryzhkov, Thatcher and the Soviet Premier were joined for the signing of agreements covering new scientific and cultural exchanges by Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who had nine hours of talks with her yesterday.

British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows. The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged. The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977. In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop. The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal. This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said. In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively. Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels. In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March. On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February. From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier. Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports. "But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home," he said.

The <British Petroleum Co of Australia Ltd> reported a 16.15 mln dlr net loss for 1986 against a 73.38 mln dlr profit in 1985 after sales fell to 2.27 billion dlrs from 2.94 billion. The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> unit attributed the deficit to stock losses arising from the drop in crude prices in the first half, when it made a 119.93 mln dlr loss. It said government compensation, in the form of subsidies to refiners to partially cover stock losses, together with improved crude prices in the second half, enabled the group's oil business to make a modest pre-tax profit. BP Australia said it had not recommended a dividend. Commenting on the year's performance, the company said it suspended operations at the 60 pct-owned Agnew Nickel mine because of losses sustained from declining nickel prices. The results also included an 11.3 mln dlr extraordinary writedown on the value of the laid-up oil exploration drillship Regional Endeavour.

One top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy. The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10 countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the IMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis.

U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said. USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres. Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels. Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said. "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year." Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said. Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres. If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program. Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels. Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels. "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production," an analyst said. A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said. High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said. In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said. "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge," he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas. Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said. U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980's. U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre. Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre. "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said. Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said. Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage. "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives," an analyst said. Reuter 

Nigeria's Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily. The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction. This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower "marginal" rate, analysts said. "It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered," a Western diplomat commented. The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26. At last week's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row. "They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend," the diplomat said. The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2. It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday's scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction. Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira. If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said. Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid. SFEM is a central part of Nigeria's structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa. The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy. The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards. Ishrat Husain, the World Bank's representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions. "So far so good" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit. Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said. Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira's black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September. REUTER 

Australian beef output is forecast to decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corp (AMLC) said. Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to 480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts. It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said. The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year, it said. The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year. It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct. The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar, the AMLC said. It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively around 94 pct of total Australian exports. REUTER 

Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest crude oil prices in a decade. Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985. The company said its more efficient operations would be necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead. The company also said that its share repurchase plan contributed to the per share gains over 1985. In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes, slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the same period as the number of wells drilled was lower. The company was also able to use lower interest rates to reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627 mln dlrs the previous year. Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6 pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct. On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from 4.8 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of shares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous year.

General Acquisition Co said it was disappointed by Gencorp's response to its tender offer and asked how the company might give better value to shareholders. Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per share tender offer from General Acquisition, an affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, and said it was studying financially superior alternatives. The General Acquisition partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had tried to discuss the offer with Gencorp. The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a "superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill." Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make takeovers more expensive. Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to put off the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock to April 6 from April 3. It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditional on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp before April 6. General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements. The partnership in its statement again urged Gencorp management to work with it to facilitate a transaction. REUTER 

Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer, either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe. Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading. Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin) Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want to remain independent," said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps. Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle, Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by 9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding. Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no steps toward a transaction. "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate battles I've seen," said one analyst. The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate. Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner. Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited from that company's restructuring. "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per share," said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson. Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and carried out a wider share repurchase. Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is seeking "greenmail," or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium. Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction. Previously associated with "junk bond" experts, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the tender offer and merger. Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however, believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction. GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8. "I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially," said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose. He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's current holdings. Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business, which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman. Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings. The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office equipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S. and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator," Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> and Monsanto Corp <MTC>, he said. Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo security guards. It also has an information services business, and is trying to sell its financial services business. Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986, earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs. GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union Carbide shares.

Jordan's key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa'i said. "First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved," he said in a television interview Saturday. "The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments." Rifa'i said Jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct. The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures. Rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued. "The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability," he said. The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel. But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices. REUTER 

Falling sales and lower world prices of fertilisers were largely responsible for the sharp increase, along with the effects of the dollar's fall which has helped to give U.S. Fibre producers a competitive edge, he told Reuters. The firm would have made a small profit in 1985 had it not been for 456 mln schillings lost by subsidiary <Merx HandelsgesmbH> on oil trading. Merx has since withdrawn from the oil market.

Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr acquisition of Gelco Corp's <GEC> Canadian unit has dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry, largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company officials and analysts said. State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second largest overnight courier business just two months after another Canadian company, <Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp <PCC>. But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out foreign owned courier operations. "It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at the right time," McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst Tony Hine commented. The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S. companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin. "There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being under siege or taking someone else over," he said. Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd as part of its previously announced program to sell off four operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters. The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program, and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of debt by year-end, the company said. While company officials declined to disclose earnings and revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs a year. The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit formed an important part of a company restructuring program, adopted after another Canadian Company, <Unicorp Canada Corp>, acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would consider acquiring the whole company. Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business. For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier business represents an "excellent financial investment" in a market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman Esther Szynkarsky said. The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service. It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs. She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline business. Gelco will continue to operate with current management, independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already operates its own air cargo business that includes a small door-to-door courier operation. "They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep it," Szynkarsky said. Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery network, generating traffic for the former parent companies without them having to tie up capital in Canada. "The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is incremental revenue," Hine said. "It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff through, the more money you make," he added. Reuter 

Taiwan's industrial production index, fell, largely as the result of the rising Taiwan dollar, by 8.18 pct to 140.06 (base 1981) in February from a revised 152.53 in January, the Economy Ministry said. It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February 1986 following a very extended rise last year. The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82. A ministry official attributed the decline to falling production of non-metal products, textiles and transportation equipment, and less mining and house construction. The official said the decline was also caused by falling exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar, which has made Taiwanese products more expensive. He expected the decline to continue in the next few months because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency. The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It closed at 34.40 to the U.S. Dollar today, and is expected to rise to about 32 to the dollar by the end of this year, foreign bankers and economists said. REUTER 

Analyst Thomas McCrann of Merrill Lynch said he reiterated a "buy" recommendation of Wang Laboratories Inc, noting that a successful cost cutting campaign could reduce the earnings loss expected for the third quarter ending in March. Wang was the most actively traded stock on the American Stock Exchange, rising 3/4 to 16-5/8. McCrann said that "Wang is a little bit ahead of where they were expected to be in their cost reductions, and as a result, the odds have increased that the loss for the quarter will be less than had been expected." McCrann said he expects Wang to report break even earnings per share or only a small loss per share for the third quarter. He said for the year, however, the company should report a loss of about 50 cts a share compared with earnings of about 35 cts a share a year ago. Reuter 

Finance and economy ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration. But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system. The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion. He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia. Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year. The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System (EMS). Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state. They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms. He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> and Mitsubishi Corp <MITT.T>, said a tight market meant it had failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a weak Australian dollar. The company said its Magna car dominated its market segment with sales of 30,500 units against 26,900 in 1985. Total sales were 64,100, down 15,900. In addition, export of components to Japan increased with 15 mln dlrs invested in 1986 to expand output of aluminium cylinder heads to 26,000 per month from 6,000, MMAL said. Imported passenger car, light commercial and heavy vehicle sales suffered while local-manufacturing profitability was eroded by sales substantially below production capacity, it said. Australian car sales fell to 530,000 in 1985 from 696,000 in 1985, although MMAL said it lifted its market penetration to 12.1 pct from 11.5 pct. No dividend was recommended. REUTER 

Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase. "Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said. "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January. "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement," he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it's most likely they'll sit and wait." "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong." In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs. "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said. "The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth." Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work. Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook. Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter. "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving," Benderley said. "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct." A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000. Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain. The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted. "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report," Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease, but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that." Reuter 

The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG, which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and other industries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projects during 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarella announced. The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure and the extension of hydroelectric facilities in the mineral-rich Guayana region, south of the Orinoco river. Sucre Figarella told a news conference the CVG's 12 companies showed an overall increase of 120 pct in profits, which rose from 1.732 billion bolivars in 1985 to 3.926 billion bolivars last year. Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit. The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of 1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt. CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's 412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042 to 1.504 bln bolivars. Meanwhile, the state iron company Ferrominera saw its profits rise from 156 mln bolivars in 1985 to 204 mln bolivars last year. Reuter 

Dart Group <DARTA> is likely seeking to buy Supermarkets General <SGL>, analysts said. "There's been rumors that they've taken a position in the company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau. Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc. The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company. The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts. Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment. Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co, said, "They <Dart> has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop." "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out," said Ballan. Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid. Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis. For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987. "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England," Comeau said. He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations. Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts. Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company's operations. Analyst Comeau said "supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company." 

Union sources said talks with the state government broke down last night, but the two sides are scheduled to meet later today in an attempt to find a compromise. Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country's most populous state were the first to be affected, and union officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless there is a quick settlement. The state government recently introduced a new workers' compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured workers by up to a third. The act is now awaiting parliamentary ratification.

General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share. GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects. "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value." However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share. After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day. The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models. But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive. "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added. Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988. Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors," he said. In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and Chrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months. Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports. Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback. "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds," he said. Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said. Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted. But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share. "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said. Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988. "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM," he said. Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important." Reuter 

Chemicals group Bayer AG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987 after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986. The company said that this was despite the mark's further strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and despite an increase in competitive pressure. "The further progress of our business will depend largely on the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy costs. Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15 billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72 billion from 1.62 billion. The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985 results, up one mark from a year earlier. Bayer said that world group operating profit declined slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed a further improvement. Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to 40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark. Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought pressure on selling prices, it added. In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against 1985, the company said without giving details. "The western Europe, North America and Far East regions developed well in local currency, but here too the translation of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture, especially in the case of North America," it said. Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in 1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks. Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986, resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset falling prices and cost increases in other areas. The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income. Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw materials all developed well, it said. Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period. Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower. Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985. REUTER 

Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said. It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan, making early rice sowing difficult. Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and sowing, the paper said. The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal. Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood season, it said. It gave no further details. The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison. REUTER 

Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates. Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially. But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate.

China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology. But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports. The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz. "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said. "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP). "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added. The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential. He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation. Reuter 

Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled." Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified," he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement," he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability," he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC," Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures." Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions," Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. REUTER 

Continuous rebel raids against oil pipelines and foreign exploration camps endanger Colombia's present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said. "It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza," he told reporters. He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela. Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details. Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage, the overall situation had improved compared with last December when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks. Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels of crude. Reuter 

Turkey is holding a buying tender for 100,000 tonnes of white sugar on March 24, traders here said. The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added. Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount. Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq. Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more. Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish 1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three seasons. The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey would export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the same amount.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price. Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, "I don't think so. I don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway." However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan. "I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans," he said. "It might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were a world market that was lower than our market." Reuter 

Utilicorp United Corp said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about 12 mln dlrs or about 1.12 dlrs a share and revenues of about 190 mln dlrs. In the comparable quarter a year ago, Utilicorp earned 8.5 mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs. There are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the 8.5 mln shares in 1986, Utilicorp's president Richard Green told financial analysts here. First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1, 1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts. Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said. However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized in September 1986, he noted. Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas operations, he said. Operating income derived from electric operations in the first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs, while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln dlrs, Green said. Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one. Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval process, he said. Hearings were completed in February and a decision by the British Columbia Utilities Commission on the 60 mln dlrs purchase by Utilicorp is pending, he said. Reuter 

Leucadia National Corp said two of its subsidiaries have acquired a 7.2 pct stake in Minstar Inc, a corporation controlled by corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and used by him in his forays to acquire stock in companies. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Leucadia said its LNC Investments Inc, a Newark, Del., investment firm, and Charter National Life Insurance Co, a St. Louis joint stock life insurance company, bought their combined 1,261,000 Minstar common shares for investment purposes only. The Leucadia subsidiaries had held an 11.0 pct stake in Minstar, but cut to 1.8 pct, or 313,200 shares, last July. Since July, Leucadia said its companies have bought 947,800 Minstar common shares for a total of 24.7 mln dlrs. Leucadia said it bought the Minstar stake to obtain an equity position in the company and has no intention of seeking control of it. Nearly half of Leucadia's common stock is owned by TLC Associates, a Salt Lake City, Utah, general partnership, whose partners include the chairman and president of Leucadia and other investors.

Columbia Gas System Inc said a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25 dlrs a share. The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs per share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986. It said management expects to recommend to the board that the dividend rate be maintained in 1987. Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax liabilities under the new federal tax laws. The company recorded these liabilities based on older, higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained. "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987 earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned," Columbia Gas said. Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary. It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary failed to sufficiently support cost recovery. The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from making a new filing to provide sufficient support. Reuter 

Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens "the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions." He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean. "The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert," General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests "because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements." Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said "If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war." But he added "We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights." Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations "we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words." Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only "The Greek fleet is not at its naval base." Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied "Obviously, and perhaps even before the war." REUTER 

Algerian and Spanish producers which together meet 40 pct of the Western market's needs in quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300 dlrs per unit, the Algerian news agency APS said. The agreement was made during a meeting here last week between Algeria's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et Substances Utiles (ENOF) and Spain's Almaden to discuss the market situation. The two firms "took note with regret that prices quoted by some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the whole market since they take into account only part of the deals made," a statement by ENOF said. The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two firms' production costs. "They have thus decided that their selling price would not be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob per jar, which is close to their production cost," the statement said. It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two firms meet again in Madrid later this month. The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange hovered around 200 dlrs this week.

Israel has drawn up a five-year plan for 1987-1991 to raise agricultural production by 500 mln dlrs to 2.7 billion dlrs, an annual rise of 3.4 pct, the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture said. Agricultural exports are to be increased by 180 mln dlrs, or 4.8 pct per year on average. The area planted to cotton is to remain at the 1986 level of 100,000 to 112,500 acres with exports expected to bring in 80 to 90 mln dlrs per year. The 34 pct decline from the 1985 level reflects continued water rationing which will remain in force, the ministry said. Groundnut production is planned to increase by 13,000 tonnes, or 57 pct, by 1991 and exports by 9,000 tonnes, or 82 pct.

Dome Petroleum Ltd's 23.2 pct stake of gold producer Dome Mines Ltd continues to be for sale "at the right price," spokesman David Annesley said in response to an inquiry. Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its stake in Dome Mines. Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment for Dome, and we have no intention of selling it." Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares. He also declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling it shares. "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of Dome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented. "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. A price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly attractive," Annesley said. Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be virtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said. Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56 major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.

A key House panel voted to greatly ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes. The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security. Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad. The issue has been the subject of administration debate. The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered. Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices. Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April. Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp., the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies. Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests. "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, a New Jersey Democrat said. The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices. The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction. At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders. Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products. Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws.

American Motors Corp's board of directors is meeting this morning in New York to consider Chrysler Corp's <C> 1.5 billion dlr takeover offer, an American Motors spokesman said. The spokesman reiterated statements made earlier in the week that the regularly scheduled meeting was being held. The spokesman would not comment on recurring speculation that the board might receive a higher offer from Chrysler. Analysts have said the fact that American Motors' stock has remained above the four dlrs a share Chrysler offer could lead the larger company to raise its bid. The American Motors spokesman said he had not seen any indication that a higher offer would be received from Chrysler, although he added, "I don't know what the conversation is in the meeting." He repeated statements made earlier in the week by the automaker that today's meeting will probably not result in a final decision on the Chrysler bid.

Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> expects continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said. He told reporters:"1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire Properties expects further good results both from properties under development for sale and from its investment property portfolio." He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78 billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago. Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG>. Miles said the company will use the money to develop its business, primarily in Hong Kong. Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from 70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25 pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the enlarged capital to the state-owned <China International Trust and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986 profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago. Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct. He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of "a marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with savings in fuel costs." "At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable for the rest of this year," he said, "though there might be a bit of increase later this year.'' Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service operations, even though the marine sector is generally depressed. "Obviously the marine industry is not getting any better," he said. The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year. Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm but said the firm has no available land for a major housing project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong island now near completion. He said the company's 50 pct unit <Hongkong United Dockyard Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing estate. "But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing," he said. REUTER 

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing. "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said. Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker said. On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade. "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made," he said. "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said. Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow. Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have to slow its spending growth. It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital. "The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts," he said. Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation, he said. Reuter 

Loans and advances from the Dutch central bank to the commercial banks were barely changed at 12.9 billion guilders in the week up to and including March 2, the central bank weekly return showed. The Treasury's account with the bank dropped 1.3 billion guilders. Dealers said a larger amount of funds in the form of interest and repayments on state loans went out than came in the form of tax payments to the state. Notes in circulation rose 360 mln to 27.7 billion as the public withdrew cash to celebrate this week's Carnival festival or take an end-of-winter holiday break, dealers said.

The cause for the rise was a rather tight 4.8 billion guilders of special advances set by the Bank yesterday compared with 8.0 billion guilders for the previous set, dealers added.

Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports. As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize. Barreto said, "My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part." He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders. Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them. "There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system," Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible. The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart. According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23. The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected. REUTER 

Liberalization of Italy's foreign exchange controls should be "gradual" but also "reasonably rapid," a report issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury Ministry said. The report, looking at the country's financial development prospects, said Italy's large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable. The report also favoured retention of the lira's six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System (EMS) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments. The lira's fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies. Italy has over recent months announced a series of deregulation moves in response to a European Community directive aimed at creating a genuine common market in goods, services and finance by 1992.

Mark IV Industries Inc <IV>, which has said it is mulling a bid to seek control of Baird Corp, said it has no present plans to acquire more than 25 pct of the company's total outstanding common stock. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mark IV said its top officials told Baird executives at a March 17 meeting that while Mark IV may buy more Baird common stock, it presently intends to hold it to the 25 pct limit. Mark IV, which first disclosed its stake and interest in Baird on March 10, has reported it holds 391,800 Baird common shares, or 17.6 pct of the total outstanding. Mark IV said it also agreed at the meeting that if it decides to seek control of Baird, it would be through a negotiated merger or business combination or through a tender offer in which Baird would have at least 24 hours notice. Baird, in turn, agreed not to take any defensive measures without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice, it said. Baird also confirmed that a takeover defense plan it already has which is triggered by the accumulation of more than 25 pct of its stock, would not be triggered by a tender offer, Mark IV said. Both parties also agreed to adjourn pending litigation they have against one another, it added. Reuter 

World Bank President Barber Conable called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for its own sake as well as that of the world economy. "Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additional support." With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said. Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage. It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America, China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world, he said. Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted. Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade. "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conable told Reuters after his speech. Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct. REUTER 

American Express Co's plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit, analysts said. American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs. The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks, as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns. The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S. firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 2.7 times book value. Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks, depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8 times book value. American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson. Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets. "I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step," said Long. "What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson," Long said. "Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation," he said of Nippon. Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally. American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company spokesman said. American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson. David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first. "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have," he said. Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public. In its statement, the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon. American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital. American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy. Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion. Analysts speculated there will be more such matches. "Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital growth," said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other U.S. brokerage companies. Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are interested in the expertise of American brokers. "Those (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money. That's a nice marriage," he said. Morgan Stanley and Co <MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8. First Boston Corp <FBC> was up one to 51-1/4. E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> rose 1-1/4 to 41-1/8, and PaineWebber Group <PWJ> climbed 7/8 to 37-3/4.

Japanese feed and starch makers actively bought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/September shipment in view of bullish freight rates following active inquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said. Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period. "Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April," one source said. The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market. Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an anticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability.

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise. He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high. The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said. Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down much further, Sumita said. "I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment," Sumita said. Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year. The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when they meet next in April.

Australia's largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters said. This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31 1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs. The analysts estimated that the group would report a third quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against 238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter. BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier. The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and steel earnings. They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been affected by industrial and production problems. The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors, and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around 300 mln dlrs. One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on capital expenditure in the steel division, they said. They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900 mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from 1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit. REUTER 

U.S. retail sales rose sharply in February but many economists said the underlying consumer spending trend remains weak. February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0 pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously reported 5.8 pct decline. "The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a much more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc. Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data over past four months to show that the pace of consumer spending is slowing. Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4 pct rise for year-over-year sales through February. "You can see a pattern developing," Maude said. "I wouldn't be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in February." Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline. "The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains in durable goods as well as non-durables," noted Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthy report." He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January. "There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said. "But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report into the future." A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost spending in February, he said. "A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding taxes from their paychecks," he said. "When people in this country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination is to go out and spend it," he said. Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of how much this sector will add to first quarter spending. Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws January 1, the Commerce Department noted. Some economists argued that the because the gain in total sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the strength in the February report is less than impressive. "There is strength in the February data, but that's because they were compared to low sales levels in January," said said Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We don't see it as a precursor of continued strength." Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling 17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained 1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January. Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February, following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales probably accounted for these gains. Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs. "On average, it looks like they'll total 120 to 121 mln dlrs in the first quartrer," she said. "We don't look at this as indication that the economy is barrelling along." "The number is not really that problematic for those of us who are constructive on the bond market," agreed Elliot Platt of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report. "The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so confusing," he said. "Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in March," he said. "But now Fed officials will have to wait for the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in April to sort things out." Reuter 

The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said. Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January's 527 mln deficit. "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said. Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level. The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards. But sentiment now looks to have turned about again. There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski. Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion. However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods. However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg. He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry. The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres, Harwood said. U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated. Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960. However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news. Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping. The Marplan poll, published in "Today," showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party, whose own support fell from 38 pct. The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said. Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again. This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantial relief," he said. However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed. REUTER 

There is little chance Soviet exports to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future, a Soviet economist said. Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want. But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future. Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987. But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year. "The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit its trading with the U.S.," he said. REUTER 

Kansas City Southern Industries Inc said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp <SFX> if the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and Santa Fe Railway. In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific. Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged from today onward. "We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value offer in cash for the Southern Pacific," said Kansas City Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H. Rowland. "This offer disproves the constant derogation of the Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said Rowland. He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime competitor, Santa Fe. Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to 1.2 billion dlrs. It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and 800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations. Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for Southern after its books, records and properties are examined. "Once that examination has been completed (and even in the absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an offer in writing...." said the company. Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each other throughout their routes. ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade. A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front. It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf. Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled, it said. Reuter 

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop.

EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for greater effort by the country to open its markets. Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the U.S. to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves. EC External Trade Commissioner, Willy De Clercq has already written to his U.S. counterpart, special U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns. The ministers' said they were "very disturbed" by the U.S. moves, adding, "the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations." Any unilateral U.S. moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), they said. In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ... (and) expect Japan to open up its market more." The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand. Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It wil be back on the table again and again," the diplomat said. De Clercq told journalists, "There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan." But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war. Reuter 

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the government was considering selling Petro-Canada and the sale would proceed if it were in the national interest to do so. Mulroney told the House of Commons assets of the huge oil company would be examined before a decision was made, just as other state-run companies were studied before being sold under Ottawa's privatization program. "The government is going to examine assets of this nature to ascertain if they continue to play an appropriate role in public policy and we will make a determination as we have in other cases," Mulroney told the daily question period. Asked by opposition members to clairify Finance Minister Michael Wilson's statement on Friday that Petro-Canada no longer has any pubilic policy role, Mulroney said his government has long promised to sell off companies that could be better run by the private sector. Outside the House, Energy Minister Marcel Masse said Petro-Canada would be worth between three and four billion dlrs and, because of the size, could be difficult to sell. He also said he would prefer to see Canadians participating in any privatization, but would not give any details on timing of a sale. Reuter 

Davis Water and Waste Industries Inc said it has restated its earnings on a pre- stock split basis for fiscal 1987's third quarter and nine months ended January 31, which were reported March 10 on a post four-for-three stock split basis. The company said its earnings per share for the third quarter on a pre-split basis, converts to 16 cts from 12 cts post-split, versus three cts pre-split from two cts post-split for fiscal 1986's third quarter. For the nine months, Davis said, earnings per share would convert to 77 cts and 44 cts for fiscal 1987 and 1986 respectively, from 58 cts and 33 cts, respectively. Reuter 

The recent fall in world sugar prices, due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said. Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly market report. "And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for May/June shipment, Man added. The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said. Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5 mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3 mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier. Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down. Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln tonnes. However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters with reduced availability, Man said. Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which has left exporters chasing falling import requirements. A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still overhanging the market, Man said. The increasing cases of record production as a result of record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers to strive for greater efficiency. As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said. Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully compensate producers when exporting on the world market. Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar is expected to remain in intervention, it added. REUTER 

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he hoped the U.S. dollar would continue to decline in relation to the currencies of Taiwan and South Korea as a way to improve the U.S. trade picture. Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, "In my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline." Asked by a committee member if he expected a further decline, and how much, Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean currencies should be adjusted to reflect "positive factors" in their economies.

The Belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988. The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet. The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates. The team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform "better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s." However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989. The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986. The report says "The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government." It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible. "Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988," the report adds. The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation. It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986. It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs.

Italian industrial production fell 3.4 pct in January, compared with the same month last year, the national statistics institute Istat said. The rise follows a year-on-year increase in December 1986 of 4.5 pct. Istat's industrial production index, base 1980, not seasonally adjusted, registered 93.3, compared with 96.6 in January 1986. Istat said there were 20 working days in January, the same as December, but one fewer than January last year. Istat said the year-on-year fall reflected poorer performances in the footwear, clothing, textiles, chemicals and metals industries. It said office machinery and data sectors, wood and furniture, precision mechanics, oil and electricity showed improved activity. Calculations based on Istat figures showed industrial production rose 2.4 pct in January, on a month-on-month basis, after falling 12.0 pct in December over November. REUTER 

Kuwait has asked at least four countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf, Reagan Administration officials said.

The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf. "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a move could create insurance and other problems, the officials said.

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris. Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals. Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely. But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals. In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels. Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained. The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said. He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen. The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord, he added. REUTER 

U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said. Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs. The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs. Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs first reported. A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the first week of the latest bank statement period. None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large regionals and the small banks. Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday -- for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason -- to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday. The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of transportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Noting that the weather was "basically good" for March, the spokesman said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a day for the full week. Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error corrections in five districts. As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.

The government's industry aid and protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said. The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system. "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes," he said. "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time," he said. Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season. The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said. He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.

A successful new GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient. "That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round," he said. "The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems." The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time. The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. "Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that's the basic objective of the new GATT round," he said. But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years. "It's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two," he said. "They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future," he said. REUTER 

CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its <Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs. The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years, the statement said. "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs. After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said. The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore production in Australia, they said. Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the Cooper-Eromanga area. "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass Strait production now under way," McGill said. In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso. He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision in view of the risks associated with the oil business. The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said. Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date, will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs. However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss, he said. He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents against 18 in 1985/86.

Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring." The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill. A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years. "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple," Izvestia said. This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

The French government is to sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe Generale <STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary <Societe Generale Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL officials said. SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland. Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs. Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said. SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985. SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal. The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said. He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France," he said. Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs. Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce its existing strong points, with no major projects planned apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch. SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said. The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone. A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling. The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy. The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday. He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall. REUTER 

Zambia has stopped sending its copper exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia said. The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but it did not say which alternative routes were being used. ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months. During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said. Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he added. Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to 98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the traditional route through South Africa. Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an interview on March 1, "My main concern, of course, is the mines because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines." According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of freight last year and is still working well below its present 1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and dependable routes his government would look to increase its usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo. The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus 79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985. Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they could be hauled there by train. "The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form handle the huge exports of Zambian copper," one western diplomat said. "A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper tonnage," he added.

The sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation, finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters. He said the current depression on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on Colombia's financial state which he described as sound. "Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us," he said. Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs. Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987. Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of 3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years, which he said was approved.

Indonesian coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas, the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Reuters. Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia, the world's third largest producer, is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas. "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position, we can never bridge the gap," Dharyono said. Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries, along with Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Papua New Guinea and Peru, which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London. Brazil, which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme, blocked the proposal. AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise. Edward Muda, an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations, said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia, the world's second largest producer, but gave no details. "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise. Without one, they will suffer if the present market stays like it is," Muda said. He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the U.S., Japan, the Netherlands, West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1. Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the U.S. And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly. He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations. Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed "realistic criteria." The breakaway group believes the old quota system, which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports, does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends. Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied. Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop. Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced, producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines. Brazil and the U.S., The largest consumer, are both refusing to alter their positions. Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices. Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system, Dharyono said. Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87, ending September 30, is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360,000 tonnes, he said. He said stocks, at 90,000 tonnes, were about average for the time of year. REUTER 

From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August, 1987. These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report. Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said. The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise. The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said. The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986's 25.8 billion dlrs. During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said. The department said the President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs. In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86, it said. Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said. Reuter 

Japan's unadjusted consumer price index (base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to 99.7 in January from the previous month, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said. The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December. The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1 pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct in September 1958. Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall decline for the month. Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities, gasoline and vegetables fell. The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down 0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs. REUTER 

French Foreign Minister Jean-Bernard Raimond predicted in a published interview a successful end to negotiations to admit Gulf petrochemical exports into the European Community (EC). Negotiations have been under way between the Community and the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for three years. Raimond, due here tomorrow from Oman for his first official visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the semi-official daily Al-Ittihad he was confident a solution would soon be reached. "I am confident that problems between the two big partners, the GCC and the EC, will find a solution. I will work to reach that solution," he said in the interview conducted in Paris. An EC decision to impose tariffs on Gulf petrochemical exports over a set quota has strained trade relations between the two sides. GCC members Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the UAE and Oman are threatening to impose heavy customs duties on European exports to the Gulf if no solution is reached. Raimond said negotiations between the two groups took a long time because there were 20 countries involved. But added: "Time is now ripe and all circumstances are appropriate for making crucial progress." Referring to the Iran-Iraq war, he said efforts should continue to find a solution despite prevailing difficulties. He said France was continuing negotiations with Iran. Some problems were solved as a result of the contacts while others remained unresolved. He gave no details but said: "France wishes to have normal relations with Iran." REUTER 

Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates. Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy. The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy. Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria, noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting. "Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy," he explained. Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down. Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller said. The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said. "Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months," he added. "All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary," Mueller said. "Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks," Mueller said. Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy. Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate. In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said. But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank. Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, Mueller said. A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator. This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said. The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports. "If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows," he said. Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high. In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter. The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said. But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. "Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else," he said. REUTER 

Prospects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview. The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988. Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975. Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was. "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," Melnikov said. "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said. Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement. "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said. Reuter 

A scheme to distribute surplus food free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a further month, an EC Commission spokesman said. He added the executive Commission has not yet decided whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm produce. Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and other food have been authorised for distribution under an operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in which charities act as executive Commission agents. The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's unusually cold European winter. The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal snowstorms, for the month of April. Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate next month. He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further, will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent. Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European currency units, would be a major consideration. End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals. REUTER 

A meeting of eight Latin American coffee producers ended with a call for continued talks aimed at arriving at an agreement to stabilize international prices. A statement delivered by the conference's president, Nicaragua's External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca, said the object of future meetings would be to seek negotiations leading to basic export quotas. The meeting was attended by representatives from Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. A Panamanian representative attended the meeting as an observer. Representatives at the meeting said efforts would continue to be made to reach a regional consensus on export quotas which could be presented to the International Coffee Organization. In opening the meeting, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said the lack of an accord on export quotas was behind falling coffee prices, which he said have caused billions of dollars in losses to countries in the region. Jorio Dauster, president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, said his government is committed to working towards an producers accord in order to bring about higher prices. REUTER 

The United States defended its sales of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with southeast Asian producers. "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesman said in a statement. "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into account in determining disposal levels," the statement said. The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983. In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The United States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding," it said. The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987, they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986. The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the GSA sold last year, however.

Esso Malaysia Bhd, a unit of Exxon Corp of the U.S., Reported net profit of 70 mln ringgit from its petroleum and ammonia operations in 1986 compared with 48.7 mln in 1985. Chairman Gerald F Cox said the improved performance was mainly due to product prices falling more slowly than crude prices during the year. He added that total sales volume increased as a result of higher offtake by affiliated companies, while inland market sales were maintained at around the previous year's levels. But growth prospects in 1987 remained weak and 1986 results are unlikely to be repeated in the current financial year. REUTER 

South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said. He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation. Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan. Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources." Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts." He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the U.S. He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be," considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense. Reuter 

Industrial production in the European Community (EC) in January showed no growth compared with January 1986, the EC statistics office, Eurostat, said in a report. It said the EC industrial production index, base 1980, stood at 103.9 in both months. EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the EC in January, it also reflects a worrying trend. Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures are known, industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with the year-earlier period. Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about 1.8 pct, well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12 months ending last June, the office said. REUTER 

The buffer stock rules agreement reached on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said. The accord was reached between producers and consumers of the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks. European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long. "If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it will do anything more than stop the price from falling further, and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate prices," a European dealer said. And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying, or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could pressure prices dramatically, dealers said. The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO, into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range. A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time. The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the "must-buy" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne specified in the agreement, the sources said. The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum 100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said. The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of which are already in the buffer stock. ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. "We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market," Bra Kanon told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000 tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee. However, some producer and consumer members emerged from the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the pact. Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings, made a formal protest to the council about the price differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock. According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West Germany, "Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There were no real winners or losers." Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as effectively as they could have, delegates said. Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock. London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg in January 1986. A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session decides market conditions warrant it, according to the agreement. The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says. The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said. REUTER 

The company declined to say how much the cost savings would amount to. A five year forecast is expected to be issued in early summer, a spokesperson said. The company said it has redeemed about 273 mln dlrs in high cost debt during 1986 and hopes to redeem more debt this year. For 1986, Niagara Mohawk's earnings per share fell to 2.71 dlrs from 2.88 dlrs in 1985.. The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of a reduction early in 1986 in earnings return on equity allowed by the N.Y. State Public Service COmmission. Niagara said it is concerned about the continued lowering of authorized return and has reinforced petitions to grant a fair return on equity. Reuter 

Alcoa officials acknowledged the possibility that they may have a position in the off-exchange aluminum options market, but declined specific comment on trade speculation that the company is holding a large outstanding position. An Alcoa (Aluminum Company of America) source involved in terminal trading for the company said: "We use all means available to manage our business, so it's a possibility we're trading options." "We won't go into specifics about what we're doing. But when you're dealing in un-alloyed ingot, it's a commodity business where there are a lot of tools available (for hedging) and Alcoa is using all of those tools," said Al Posti, Alcoa's manager of corporate news. Trade sources have said Alcoa is long call options equal to 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes of aluminum due to mature in April and May. However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they believe the size of Alcoa's position has been exaggerated. The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the second quarter, traders said. "If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would mean really squeezing the market," one New York trader said, noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were 90,500 tonnes at the end of last week.

French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets. The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here. "I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annual conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88. Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months. There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output. But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA's farmers. His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers. Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm sector. "The Minister's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a ministerial level. Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring. Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister. There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers' indebtedness, he said. Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire. The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said. Reuter 

A decision by Colombia to open coffee export registrations for an unlimited amount does not imply the country will heavily sell coffee until recently withheld, Gilberto Arango, president of the private exporters' association, told Reuters. Colombia today opened export registrations for april and may, with the National Coffee Growers' Federation setting no limit. Since the start of the coffee year last october, private exporters were on average allowed 350,000 bags of 60 kilos per month. "Traders will initially interpret this measure as announcing heavy sales. Even today it pressured the market. But it will quickly become apparent that Colombia does not intend to go over the top," Arango said in an interview. "Colombia's marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately. Colombia has no intention to give its coffee away," he added. Arango described measures adopted here yesterday, including a lower export registration price, as a major change in Colombia's coffee marketing policy. The export registration price, or reintegro, was lowered to 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock new york, or 155.83 dlrs per bag of 70 kilos, from 1.35 dlrs (194.33 dlrs). The government announced a more flexible policy of reintegro, in order to closely reflect market trends, which arango warmly welcomed saying private exporters will undoubtedly be more actively present in the market. A frequent gap between international market prices and the reintegro was unlikely to recur, he said. Reuter 

U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war. "The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I've ever seen it in six years in Washington," Baldrige said in a weekend television interview. "I think we'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration, but there is a hardening trade attitude," he said. President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation. However, Baldrige warned measures that would penalize trading partners such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill.

Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers. The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow. Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said. USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage. It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said. The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold. The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said. However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said. The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year. USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel. Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters. Reuter 

A committee of independent directors of the Standard Oil Co unsuccessfully sought a delay in a tender offer for Standard shares by British Petroleum Co plc, according to offering documents. BP's offering document for its 70 dlr per share offer describes discussions with Douglas Danforth, who chairs a special committee of independent directors responsible for monitoring relations with BP. BP has been owner of a 55 pct stake in Standard for several years. According to the document, the committee's counsel said it needed one to two months to evaluate the offering price. Danforth, who is chairman of the Westinghouse Electric Co <WX>, first learned of BP's interest in acquiring the rest of Standard in a telephone call March five from Sir Peter Walters, chairman of BP. At a meeting march nine, Danforth informed BP that the special committee had hired First Boston Corp <FBC> as its financial adviser and also retained independent counsel. Danforth's concerns that the special committee did not have sufficient time were expressed to Walters in a telephone conversation and reiterated in a letter from counsel on Monday of this week.

The European Community (EC) agreed tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast stretches of the region's forests. Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes. The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and for all new vehicles from October 1990. The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all heavy vehicles applied to the new standards. There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in the EC, according to Commission figures. The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn requested permission to do so to encourage the use of low-pollution cars, diplomats said. West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC environment ministers meet next on May 21. But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol. Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20 mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol. Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol. Reuter 

The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security. The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration's export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit. The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries. Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year. "This is Congress' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more," the Washington Democrat said. The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls. Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments. It would also give the Commerce Department primary authority to decide which exports will be permitted and limit the Defense Department to an advisory role in reviewing requests to export highly-sensitive technology.

Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie said. In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded. The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work." Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment. Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992. The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way. The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic. Reuter 

Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said. In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar, sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure. "So far G-6 has been a roaring success,"said James O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA. "The central banks are sending strong signals that they won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies," added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank. On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K. -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels. The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies. And initially, traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower. But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord. The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing. But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines. Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions. But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around 1.85 marks. "The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon," said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill. Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact. Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen. The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election. "There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870 dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. "There's been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's U.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks, they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise. The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday. And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent, sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday. Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months. The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night. Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately. "Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said. Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders, lower industrial output and slowing employment gains. Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31. Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency. In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28. On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen. "Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount. Reuter 

Canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said. American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing. Such action "would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian banks to do the same," Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters. "They (banks) like to appear to be conservative," said Pulcine, "and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non-performing and another bank is not." Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp <CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks. "In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have to have the support of the other banks," said Meredith. Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify, "wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position." Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt. Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days. They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending July 31. <Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank creditor, said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as non-performing. "I think that is just for the benefit of the public," Walsh said of Bank of Montreal's statement. Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans non-performing. They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income. "From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks will get the money," said Meredith. "My outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's earnings." Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3.80 dlrs for <Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in 1986; 4.30 dlrs for <Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25 dlrs for <Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with 2.23; 2.15 dlrs for <Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94, and 2.85 dlrs for <Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74. She forecast 1.90 dlrs for <National Bank of Canada> against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split. Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share, assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs. "If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario," Pulcine said. Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the Brazilian debt situation was so complex that "it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year." He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings. Reuter 

The Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986, private economists said. Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand, was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year, the economists said. They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years. The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous quarter. It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from 4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis. They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales. But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off. "Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division. He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise. Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor. Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures, he said. Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute, said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins. "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter," Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign. Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending. Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax. REUTER 

The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said. But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements. "Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates," he said. "The money market rates are the important ones." Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations. An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation, braking the expansion of money supply. "Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time," he added. Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy, since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark. Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year. After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the economy should show an uptrend in the last three. "We don't believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a 'growth dip,'" Seipp said. But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct. The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth. Seipp added the federal government should make "further courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility." Reuter 

U.S. money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February. A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy. M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs. The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs. M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3. With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say. M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation. But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed," McCarthy said. Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's coming in a lot weaker than I thought." The economists were quick to caution that one month's data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks. Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion. But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus. McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago," he noted. He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct. Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past." There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market."

China's grain imports will rise in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters. They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982. An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985. Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports, which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985. "China is short of foreign exchange," the Shanghai official said. "We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer." A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought, low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption. "At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs," the trader said. The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year's level. The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986. "All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and high-yield cash crops," it said. It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought. Since January, the press has devoted much attention to grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low. Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output. The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers. Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits. Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province. "In addition, we are setting up grain production bases, raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other infrastructure," he said. The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases, they lease the land to grain farmers. The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made profitable. "The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption. Only this will boost enthusiasm," it said. REUTER 

Minister of Mines Patrick Chitambala confirmed that Zambia had ended copper shipments through South Africa and announced that its state-run mining company had closed down its liaison office in the white-ruled republic. He told the official Times of Zambia newspaper in an interview the government was diverting all mineral exports along rail routes to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Beira in Mozambique. Chitambala declined to say what volume of copper and other minerals were being shipped through these two ports, but he said there had not been any problem with the new arrangements. "So far our copper has been reaching its destinations without hindrance," he told the Times. The Times of Zambia quoted unnamed sources as saying Zambia exported 100,000 tonnes of copper through Dar es Salaam and 17,000 through Beira in the last quarter of 1986. Diplomatic sources in Lusaka had earlier expressed doubts over Zambia's ability to ship all its copper through Beira and Dar es Salaam without causing massive bottlenecks at the ports. Chitambala also said that the state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) had closed its liaison office in Johannesburg, since it was now redundant. Reuter 

The tin price is likely to rise to 20 ringgit a kilo this year because of the producers' accord on export quotas and the reluctance of brokers and banks to sell the metal at lower prices, a Malaysian government bulletin said. The Malaysian Tin bulletin said it is in producers' interest to keep to their quotas to limit total exports to 90,000 tonnes and to gradually deplete the 80,000 tonnes overhang. It said consumption by industrialised countries should stay at 160,000 tonnes and that International Tin Council creditors and brokers are not likely to dump their stocks excessively unless there is a large and abrupt price jump. The continued depreciation of the dollar could also help push up the price of tin, the bulletin said. A depreciation of the dollar means the depreciation of the ringgit which is closely pegged to it, making the price of tin cheaper in sterling terms, it added. "Even in the absence of economic rationale in the tin market, psychological optimism alone is sufficient to secure a price recovery of up to 20 ringgit per kilo," the bulletin said. REUTER 

Telecom Plus International Inc said <Siemens AG>'s Siemens Information Systems wants to amend its agreement to purchase Telecom's 65 pct interest in Tel Plus Communications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months. Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln dlr transaction Monday. Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change. Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters. Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations and warranties are true. Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information which would make its representations and warranties untrue. Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The 65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset. A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year on the anniversary date of the transaction. He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months. Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of certain intercompany debt until completion of the review. Telecom said it estimates this to ba about 15 mln dlrs. Reuter 

CrossLand Savings FSB said it has acquired Western Savings and Loand Co with the assistance of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. CrossLand said Salt Lake City based Western has been combined with its two Florida-based thrift subsidiaries. The parent company contributed 50 mln dlrs in cash to the resulting 1.7 billion dlr asset subsidiary which will operate under the name CrossLand Savings FSB with headquarters in Salt Lake City. CrossLand said Western, with assets of 400 mln dlrs, operated 13 branch offices in the states of California, Oregon, Utah and Washington. To facilitate the acquisition, CrossLand said, Western was converted from a mutual to a stock association in a voluntary supervisory conversion. Crossland and the FSLIC executived an assistance agreement indemnifying CrossLand from certain losses that could occur in connection with Western's loan portfolio. The company said James J. Heagerty, chairman and chief executive officer of CrossLand Savings FSLA in Bradenton, Fla., will serve in that capacity for the new subsidiary resulting from the merger. Western's president, Christopher J. Sumner, will be president of the combined unit, CrossLand said. Reuter 

Tenneco Inc, a company that has long been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts said. Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment to make whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment. Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco. Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4. Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover attempt. "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his group may be interested," Feretti said. "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a challenge." Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA> last winter, has made no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said. Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at 58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of about 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive to Pickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value well into the 60 dlr a share range. "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile takeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors. "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said the buyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems" Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy businesses. Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership out of its natural gas pipeline interests. An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged the Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with his holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "I don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion dlrs on the market today."

Peru's biggest state mining firm, Centromin SA, said today there was no immediate force majeure possibility on its copper shipments after guerrillas blew up a railway line, interrupting train traffic from the Cobriza copper mine to the Pacific coast. A Centromin spokesman said the managers of the mine at Cobriza could always ship the the mineral by road to the coast for export if the train line continued interrupted. Cobriza produced the equivalent of around 40,600 fine tonnes of copper last year. Maoist guerrillas using dynamite interrupted train traffic two days ago when they blew up railway tracks and derailed a train laden with minerals 225 km (135 miles) east of Lima at Chacapalca, between the coast and Cobriza. An official at Minero Peru Comercial, Minpeco, Peru's state minerals marketing firm, confirmed there had been no declaration of force majeure on the shipments from Cobriza. Officials at National Train Company, Enafer, headquarters in Lima, the Peruvian capital, declined to comment on when train traffic would be restored to Cobriza.

A Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm. "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues," Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American Division told Reuters. U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T>, U.S. Officials said yesterday. Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale. U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales. Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner, Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division. In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers. Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said. Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying "the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor market." Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said. The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said. U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field. "The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied, and this is a bullying ploy," Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said. However, the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors. "The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley," said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co. U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market. A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact. "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem," he told Reuters. Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters. REUTER 

Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand," he said. Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter 

Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee," Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review." "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day," he said. The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports. "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995," Herrington said. Reuter 

U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes. The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers' labels. The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods. Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue. But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid." He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease," he said. A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans. Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels," said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice." The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels. Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease." Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease. The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated. David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat. Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates. U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures. Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier. Reuter 

Indonesia has protested to the European Community (EC) about its plan to raise import duties on vegetable oils, which will affect the country's palm oil exports to the EC, Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh said. "Indonesia, both individually and together with other members of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), has protested against the EC plan to increase duties on vegetable oil imports," he told Indonesian reporters. "We very much regret the community's plan," he added. He did not say in what form the Indonesian protest was made. Indonesia is a major palm oil producer. According to central bank figures, Indonesia exported 362,700 tonnes of crude palm oil to EC countries in calendar 1985 and 301,400 tonnes in the first 10 months of 1986. Complete 1986 figures are not yet available. Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said recently that the increase in EC duties would add a new burden to ASEAN countries at a time when they were trying to strengthen their economies in the face of lower commodity prices.

The European Monetary System marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system, which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy. Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar. And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin. But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. Under this phase, originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund. But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters. "The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common," said one economist who has closely watched the system's development. The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar. Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system. MORE As the mark soared against the dollar, it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors. And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark's rise, the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community. Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system -- the French franc, Italian lira, the Irish punt and Danish crown. Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world currency, outside the system. No change in the British government's attitude is expected before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988. Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it. Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month. But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change. "Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level," said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department. Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they predict. REUTER 

Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said. The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86. In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags. The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation. Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988. Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000 tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987. The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985. The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans. The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants. Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags. Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123,000 tonnes in 1986. Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985. The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market. REUTER 

French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was "increasingly ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets." "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months," it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries." This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly," it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost," one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue," it said. REUTER 

Millen specializes in Jewish religious cards and also sells traditional greeting cards. Reuter 

Mario Branco Peres, president of the Brazilian Association of Citrus Juice Industries (Abrassuco), welcomed a decision by the U.S. Commerce Department sharply cutting its duties on imported frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) from Brazil. Speaking by telephone from Sao Paulo, Peres said, "With its decision, the U.S. government recognised the honesty of Brazilian exporters, who never have the intention of practising dumping." In a final ruling yesterday, the U.S. government eliminated the duties shipped by Sucocitrico Cutrale and cut to 1.96 pct the duty on Citrosuco. Duties of 8.54 pct had been set last October. Peres said Brazil had enough orange juice to meet the needs of its major clients. "We do not have in stock what we would like to have, but we certainly have enough orange juice available to supply our buyers," Peres said, declining to estimate the amount of the current stock. "To keep it a secret is part of our strategy," he added. Peres said the price policy of the orange juice was based on market conditions. "There is nothing better than a free trade policy," he said. Cutrale and Citrosuco officials were not immediately available for comment. Reuter 

Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week. Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said. Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration. VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time. He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the Conservation Reserve Program. Reuter 

U.S. farmers who reorganize their operations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add 2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agricultural programs by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said. "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizations continue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900 mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley said.

The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. REUTER 

A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today. "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention. Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention. At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level. Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so. Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date. The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers. REUTER 

The surge in currency futures since Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the coming week, financial analysts said. "The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it to last a little longer," said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co. Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today, is likely to continue, he said. Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said, even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said. Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord. "I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes," Horner said. Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures. "Coordinated, punishing intervention" by the central banks -- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to Horner. "I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans (currencies)," he said. On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract, is at 0.007050, Horner said. Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak. "The basic trend in the currencies is higher," said Anne Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The market wants to take the dollar lower." Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week, Mills said. In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role in coming sessions, the analysts said. Friday's employment statistics in particular will be closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of 250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar. Reuter 

First Interstate Bancorp Chairman Joseph Pinola said the bank holding company would lose about 16 mln dlrs per year, after taxes, if it had to put its medium and long-term debt on non-accrual status. In an interview, he said that could result in about a 4.5 pct decline in annual earnings per share. Pinola said First Interstate, like other banks, has not yet decided to put the loans, which Brazil stopped paying interest on last month, on non-accrual status. "None of us really wants to injure negotiations that might be going on," he said. First Interstate reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that it has about 339 mln dlrs in medium-to long-term loans to Brazil. It said on December 31, 1986 its nonperformind Brazilian outstanding debt totaled about 4.1 mln dlrs. First Interstate also has about 168 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade lines to Brazil. Pinola said he believes the solution to the Brazilian debt crisis will be more political than economic, which he said he finds, "very disquieting and discomforting." Reuter 

The average weekly earnings of U.S. workers after adjustment for inflation and seasonal changes rose 0.6 pct in February after being unchanged in January, the Labor department said. The department had earlier reported that real earnings fell 0.3 pct in January but revised the figure to show earnings unchanged. Between February this year and February, 1986, real earnings rose 0.5 pct, the department said. The rise in February real earnings resulted from a 0.5 pct increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.6 pct increase in average weekly hours. That was partly offset by a 0.4 pct rise in the consumer price index, which measures inflation, the department said. Before seasonal adjustment, weekly earnings last month averaged 307.59 dlrs, up from 305.13 dlrs in January and up from 300.66 dlrs in February, 1986. Reuter... 

Sugar which EC producers plan to sell into intervention may be offered by the European Commission for sale within the Community, broker C. Czarnikow says in its latest sugar review. The Commission will propose to offer the sugar at a very nominal premium of 0.01 European Currency Unit (Ecu) to the intervention price, with detrimental consequences for producers' returns, Czarnikow says. The move is seen as an attempt to persuade the producers to take back the surrendered sugar. The Commission may also take other steps to dissuade producers from their chosen course, such as removing the time limit on storage contracts, which presently means that intervention stocks have to be removed by the end of September, Czarnikow says. There is also the possibility of production quotas being reduced. If the Commission decided to offer the sugar to traders for export, the restitutions would have to be higher than those at recent export tenders, Czarnikow notes. To match the difference between the EC price and the world market price, the extra costs might be as much as 20 Ecus per tonne, it says. The producers might have to repay these costs through production levies and the proposed special elimination levy, Czarnikow says, but it would be several months before any costs could be recovered under EC rules. The primary cause of the plan to sell 775,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in France is dissatisfaction with the EC export program as the restitution has increasingly failed to bridge the gap between the EC price and the world market price, Czarnikow notes. The French move is thus seen as a form of protest designed to force the Commission's hand. In West Germany, 79,250 tonnes have been tendered for intervention, but Czarnikow says the motive here is to ensure that the 1986/87 price is paid for sugar that was produced in 1986. In addition to a two pct cut in the intervention price, West German producers face a further price reduction in July with a probable revaluation of the "green" mark. Even if the immediate crisis is resolved, the problem is not expected to disappear permanently. It has appeared to traders for some years that the EC's export policy is insufficiently responsive to changing patterns of demand, it says. The weekly tenders should respond to fluctuating demand by increasing or reducing the tonnage awarded, Czarnikow says, suggesting that the Commission might also take steps to cut down the amount of "unnecessary bureaucracy" surrounding the export tender system.

The government is determined to ride out the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove temporary, senior officials said. "The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one senior Finance Ministry official said. He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year. That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock (0100 GMT)," he said. After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning, the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20. Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen. Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall. One official even called the market's recent actions irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He said. As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month's meeting of major nations in Paris. "We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy stance," one senior official said. 

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's annual report says. One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be restored to current earnings status, it said. As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed. Continental said it decided to deal with this change "in its entirety" in 1987. Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation rules, and although the impact will not be material in the short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report said. The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by 17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said. Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8 mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in 1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it said. Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental takes place, the report said. This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted. In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in the form of common stock. Reuter 

Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5 mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement. Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake. Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said. Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that would take an estimated five months. Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired. Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output was around 260,000 bpd. Reuter 

U.S. Based speciality food retailer <Mrs Fields Inc>, which earlier announced pre-tax profits of 17.1 mln dlrs in 1986 against 6.8 mln in 1985, said it plans further growth this year with the opening of 125 new stores in the U.S. The company, which is quoted on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM), said it also planned to expand its outlets internationally. However, chairman Randall Fields told a news conference the company would not move into any new countries during 1987 but would intensify its efforts where it already had stores. During 1986 the company opened 81 new stores, including 76 in the U.S., Two in Australia and one each in Japan, Canada and the U.K. "We intend to open a minimum of five more units in London for example and it is reasonable that we might open other stores in other European countries in 1988," Fields said. He said the company acquired competitive businesses as a matter of routine, and might add others in 1987, but declined to say how much the company planned to spend on them. Last year turnover rose by 20.8 pct to 87.1 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln dlrs in 1985. Reuter 

Firmer crude oil prices, government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry analysts said. They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct. On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at record highs. "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said. Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year's results, analysts said. "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future," Gobert commented. The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986. Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4. Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2. Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said. "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant," he added. Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs. But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed. Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices. However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts. Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels. "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report. "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added. In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work. "The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected," Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said. Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results. The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned. Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said. "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more," Maciej said.

Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts. In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share. Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year. He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share. Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share. In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone." President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co. Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago. He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I.

The western industrialised nations have agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD said. The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world's least developed nations. Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD, which hosted the reform negotiations, said. Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year. The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage. OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added. By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use. "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here commented. REUTER 

Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982. In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd. The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct. Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985. Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production.

European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept. Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand. Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988. He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis." But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red. Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said. Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990. Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year. Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed. Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments. The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes. Reuter 

The House Ways and Means Committee completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws, chairman Dan Rostenkowski said. The committee's consideration of one of the most controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States, was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10 pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such as Japan. The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate international trade agreements but it allows him to wave retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S. economy. The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions to grant domestic industries import relief. It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These powers are currently held by President Reagan. The administration has strongly objected to this transfer of authority from Reagan to Yeutter. The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April. Reuter 

Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said. Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said. Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely. Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.

The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement. The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987. The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased. While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices. The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls. The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said. REUTER 

The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said. Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains. Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split. However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs. Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market. Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months after harvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time. Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions. Reuter 

Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a "strategic reserve" target of two mln tonnes. Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. The government wants to keep an extra "safety margin" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran. Reuter 

French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct, the same as last year, due to an international environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying. Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct. Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth, the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and exports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les Echos. Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct and 1.1 pct growth in 1985. He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit to 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985. He has already announced his intention of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989. REUTER 

West Germany's chemical industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987 turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said. Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>, told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as well as crude oil and commodity prices. Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986. The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said. Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price competition and increased costs. Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years, neutralized the negative impact. Strenger said the industry would try to increase production in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of West Germany. The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and 22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East. Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct. Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late last year. REUTER 

A Portland-based wood products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq, Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co said yesterday. Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs. The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity under the credit guarantee program, he said. Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee program (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key to opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by Scandinavian lumber producers. "This is the first time we have been able to sell wood products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term export market for U.S. lumber products." He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing, construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six pct. Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale late last month and early March. He is a member of the United States-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed to promote commerce with Iraq. The forum members include Westinghouse and General Electric, but Niedermeyer's company is the only wood products firm on the membership roster. Reuter 

World grain trade could be turning the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a Cargill, Inc. analyst said. Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows. He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets. Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.

"Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement. The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago. Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities. The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year. Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago. Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said. The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages. Reuter 

India's castor oil exports are provisionally estimated at 30,000 tonnes in fiscal 1986/87, ending March 31, against 54,000 tonnes in 1985/86 due to a shortfall in the domestic castorseed crop, private traders said.

China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said. Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where "pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed." "We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000," he said. "We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain." The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details. REUTER 

It said it and the Toussie-Viner group, with which it made the merger offer, were assessing their options regarding the Heck's investment. Viner earlier reported a fourth quarter loss of 918,000 U.S. dlrs after a 1.5 mln dlr writedown of its stake in Heck's. It earned 585,000 dlrs in the previous fourth quarter.

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon will present a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules to producer and consumer delegates either later today or tomorrow morning, delegates said. Bra Kanon held private bilateral consultations with major producers and consumers this morning to resolve outstanding differences, mostly on the issues of how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can purchase and price differentials for different varieties. Delegates were fairly confident the differences could be worked out in time to reach agreement tomorrow. Some consuming member nations, including Britain and Belgium, favour the buffer stock buying more than 10 pct non-member cocoa, delegates have said. The consumers argue that buying cheaper, lower quality non-member cocoas, particularly Malaysian, will most effectively support prices because that low quality cocoa is currently pressuring the market. Producers, meanwhile, say non-member cocoa should make up at most a very small percentage of the buffer. They say Malaysia should not be able to benefit from the ICCO unless it is a member, and if the buffer stock bought Malaysian cocoa Malaysia would have no incentive to join, delegates said. As to differentials, Ghana apparently wanted a higher differential for its cocoa than is outlined in the most recent proposal, so it would have a better chance of having its cocoa bought for the buffer stock, producer delegates said. Some consumers wanted differentials to be adjusted in a way that would not promote buffer stock purchases of the more expensive cocoas, such as Ghanaian and Brazilian, they said. Other technical points need to be sorted out, including limits on how much cocoa the buffer stock manager can buy in nearby, intermediate and forward positions and the consequent effect on prices in the various deliveries, delegates said.

Silver looks "unlikely to break out of gold and platinum's shadow" in the near future, although this year is likely to see demand increasing at a faster rate than supply, a study by Credit Suisse said. The study predicted demand rising by 300 tonnes to 13,200 tonnes this year, against a 50 tonne increase in supply to 14,050 tonnes. This should cut the global oversupply to 850 tonnes from last year's provisional 1,100 tonnes. The study noted that the effects of last year's lower prices were having a dampening effect on total supply, which was now back down to around levels of a decade ago. However, the study said that primary production, likely to reach 10,000 tonnes this year against a provisional 9,950 in 1986, is relatively insensitive to price falls. Around a third of silver production comes from heavily indebted Mexico and Peru. Price-sensitivity is also reduced by the fact that the majority of silver is a by-product of other mining activity.

Engineering group Linde AG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same 1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said. But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and incoming orders increased 1.0 pct. Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group 1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln. Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to 394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln. Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13 to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks. Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for acquisitions. He declined to give further details. While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91 billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level. World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4 pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to 739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge. World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05 billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05 billion marks. Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks. The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group sales rising 12.4 pct to 1.52 billion marks and incoming orders gaining 8.0 pct to 1.57 billion marks.

The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries, economists said. "The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports," said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest. Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress, the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade. The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods. U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year. But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack. "In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing," said Robert Chandross, of Lloyds Bank PLC. Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986. The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion. And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago. Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation. Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987. The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the area of "big-ticket" manufactured goods, notably cars. Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985. "The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers," said Bob Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports, 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment. A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries. But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says. Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion. Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. "A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan's expense," said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies. But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say. The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct. But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say. "We've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes," said Bethlehem Steel's Wendt. And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect. Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration's free-trade stance. "It's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then the question is, will it have teeth?" one economist said. Reuter 

OPEC believes world oil prices should be set around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs a barrel, OAPEC Assistant General Secretary Abdelaziz Al-Wattari said today. In a speech to a European Community (EC)/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here, Al-Wattari said: "OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs." But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries, who had been forced to curtail production, and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases. "For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel, its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production," Al-Wattari said. "Such cutbacks ... Cannot, in certain cases, be sustained," Al-Wattari said. As well as financial and marketing pressures, some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies, he added. Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February, although this had meant sacrifices. The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability, though restored to a good level, was still under pressure, Al-Wattari said. "A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation," he added. He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC. But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC, they were insufficient in terms of volume, he added. "The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC's calls for supply regulation," he said. Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue, while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC. Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures, he added. Fadhil Al-Chalabi, OPEC Deputy Secretary General, also addressing the seminar, added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market. Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides, Al-Chalabi said, adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue. Reuter 

Federal Reserve Board governor Robert Heller said that the dollar's current level is appropriate but declined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted central bank intervention this week. "The dollar is stable again... The current level is the appropriate level," Heller told reporters after a speech to a meeting of financial services analysts. He said last month's six-nation currency accord in Paris did not include target ranges for the dollar in an "academic way." Heller also said that it was too early to determine whether the parties to the six-nation accord were taking appropriate steps to carry out the longer-term economic adjustments agreed to in Paris. "Clearly, they've not been implemented yet... No one expects implementation within a week or two," he said. Earlier today, U.S. Treasury assistant secretary told a Senate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities.

Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance. Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production. "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said. Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment. The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said. And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted. Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas. Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses. Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices. However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said. "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community," he said. Reuter 

Farm subsidies and protectionist moves threaten healthy trade on both sides of the Atlantic, Michael Jopling, British minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, warned. "It would not be sensible to provoke another dispute between Europe and the United States," Jopling said in remarks prepared for an evening speech. "But some things are clear and they apply on both sides of the Atlantic. We cannot continue to pile up stocks while world demand shrinks," he said. "Governments must not operate farm policies as if they were purely domestic affairs with no impact on others. They also have to recognize that they cannot in the long run develop a healthy and stable farm sector on the basis of protectionism and excessive subisdies. "And above all, Europe and the United States have too many common interests to make it worthwhile to engage in trade wars and competitive export subsidies which end by benefitting no one." He added, "It is crucial that the United States and the European Community remain friends." Jopling, who is a member of the EC agriculture committee, was in Indiana to visit several farms prior to talks with U.S. officials in Washington later this week. Jopling also criticized a recent proposal still under consideration by the EC for a tax on vegetable and fish oils. He said his government would oppose such a move because "We do not think it is correct that a shortage of funds to support (EC) farmers should be alleviated by raising money at the consumer's expense."

Hillsdown Holdings Plc <HLDN.L> said early results for 1987 were encouraging, and the combination of its investment and acquisition strategies enabled it to look forward confidently for an excellent result for the year. The company was commenting on 1986 results which showed pre-tax profit rising to 54.9 mln stg from 33.4 mln previously on turnover that lifted to 1.70 billion from 1.13 billion. The figures initially boosted the share price to 286p from 281p last night, but they then eased back to 283p by 0830 GMT. Hillsdown said capital expenditure rose in 1986 to 60 mln stg from 31.5 mln and would continue at this high level in 1987. The placing of 82.5 mln shares last year raised 160.7 mln stg and enabled shareholders' funds to more than double to 352 mln at year-end. Net borrowings were 20 pct of shareholder's funds and the group had listed investments of 47.1 mln. The company said it had bought a total of 40 companies during the year for a total price of some 180 mln stg. Although these had made minor contribution to profits the real benefits would come in 1988 and beyond. REUTER 

Japan's ailing shipyards have won approval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash production to about half of total capacity for one year, effective April 1, industry sources said. The approval follows an act of parliament passed last week designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of capacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said. The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructing ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuilding output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes in 1987/88, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said. Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel in 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish. Last week's temporary act of parliament also allows shipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50 billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity. Up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasing redundant land and equipment from shipbuilders. The Ministry will start drawing up its restructuring guidelines from April 1 and the yards will implement the guidelines from September, industry sources said. REUTER 

Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country's international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said. Under the system, importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange. Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago. The system will be effective until the end of 1988. A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council. Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985. Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in 1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary estimates. The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3 billion dlr foreign debt. REUTER 

Pay talks aimed at ending a week-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and the strike will continue, a union official said. The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters. The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma). Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute. He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa. Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to the government, which has suspended interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance. The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports. "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment and it is not conceivable that exports be hit," he told the Gazeta Mercantil newspaper. Reuter 

The Philippines' Social Security System (SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer <San Miguel Corp> (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del Rosario said. He told reporters the government organisation had expressed interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a share. The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and sequestered by the government. The block is split between class A and class B stock. SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N. Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres Soriano, del Rosario said. The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices. Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to unidentified foreign purchasers. He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares. President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the shares. Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on Good Government. The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd <ADSA.S> (Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and investment, both in Australia and overseas. The group announced the issue with its first half earnings and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed by a one-for-four bonus issue. Adsteam's equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16. Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60 and yesterday's close of 14.50 on the issue announcement. The issue will be underwritten by <Morgan Grenfell Australia Ltd> and <McCaughan Dyson Ltd> apart from the shares to be taken up by Adsteam's associate and largest shareholder, department store retailer <David Jones Ltd>. New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will rank equally thereafter. Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both issues from 99.36 mln. Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance. David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest associates' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln a year earlier, Adsteam's figures show. Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn. Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue. REUTER 

Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said he expects the country's 1986/87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the August budget. Keating told a financiers' dinner that February's 750 mln dlr deficit, against January's 1.23 billion, was "in the groove" of the government's expectations. "We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget," Keating said. "I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP." Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend. Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election, because it would take time to stabilise Australia's 80 billion dlr foreign debt. "We have to build the import competing sector back," he said. "We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing." Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation. The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14, he said. REUTER 

President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House officials said. There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the move could come today or early next week. Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors. The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd. They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.

The rebates granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender represent a further concession to producers' complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the bloc, trade sources said. They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into intervention. The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week was 2.5 Ecus below this level. But the sources said producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that they intend to withdraw these offers. The French and German operators involved would be able to withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores. The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar going into intervention and payment being made for it. EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move which could drive down market prices further. REUTER 

Current interest by Soviet charterers in taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX), dealers said. Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is calculated on spot physical rates. No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said. "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said. Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month. Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand. Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said. They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year. Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest. Reuter 

Costa Rica's economy minister said he sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas. Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing- nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london. Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weight of the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations. Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand. "There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas," Escalante said. At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said. The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic," Escalante said. Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand. "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in the world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust." Reuter 

Tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumper harvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday. The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it. The state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country. NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania.

The U.S. index of leading indicators fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said. The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December. The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct. The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment. A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline. Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance. Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock prices, new business formation, average work week and money supply. The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation. There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November. The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November. The index of lagging indicators, which measures past economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of 0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November. Reuter 

President Reagan said the United States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil. President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying. "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more," he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations. Reuter 

Finland's mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy <OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability. Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres. Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982. Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, <Metallverken Ab> and <Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that were merged into its copper processing division. The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion. The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries <Nippert Co> and <Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo. Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this year. The new division will have production plants in Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S. REUTER 

Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said. One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year repayment term. Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday. Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue. One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar. The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture. Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992. Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware, the officials said. An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said. Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977 when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing ally and turned to the U.S.. REUTER 

U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact. "Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said. The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31. Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln. Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. "The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing," he added. The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures. Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures. Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitely looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than expected." The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve. Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures. "I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the long run," she said. Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition. "It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program," she said. Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's. Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres. New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program, despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures.

The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability to attract other offers or take other actions that would benefit holders of preferred stock. The complaint also alleges federal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary duty.

The European Community (EC) yesterday warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners, that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations with both countries. EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already distanced itself from the bill. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns. The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S. Moves towards protectionism. "The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral relations," it said. Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it said. In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more." The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand. Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. "It will be back on the table again and again," the diplomat said. De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said, "There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan." The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its trade surplus, and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers, where it has imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties. But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research.

Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson. "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not." ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive." Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

Malaysia's state oil company Petronas will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May 1, trade sources said. Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices, and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986's target level. Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-1987. However, the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987. The ministry's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel (bbl), but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks, the sources said. Malaysia's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July, they said. Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output. The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices, as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives, the sources said. In addition to term sales, Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender, the sources said. However, this practice is likely to dwindle given the reduced scale of production, they said. 

Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said in a newspaper interview that no OPEC member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the 13-nation group. Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba "All OPEC states, without exception, are producing within the quotas allocated to them. Some of them are producing less." Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its quota since OPEC returned to quotas last September, was still pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of this year. Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell. OPEC agreed in December to cut overall oil production by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the first six months of this year and abide by fixed prices around 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.

The U.S. grain planting intentions and stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said. The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are "the first report we've had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc. "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln. The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels of wheat, all below trade guesses. Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports. Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel "if the bell rang right now." "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and soybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog and poultry production is up. "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand," said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter. However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption. She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states, where yields are usually low. "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's opening," she said. Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from last year's 8.25 billion bushels. "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6.7 billion bushels. Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices." Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans. The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill. "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we're working under today, and this report should reinforce that," Frazier said. "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region. Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world." U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were "misleading propaganda." He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension." Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway." "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area," he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region. REUTER 

National Semiconductor Corp said improved results at its Semiconductor Group helped reduce losses in the third quarter and nine months. In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales increase and major improvement in operating performance compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said. But results softened from the prior quarter because of low bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday shutdowns, it said. The semiconductor maker cut net losses to 25.6 mln dlrs or 31 cts a share from 39.4 mln dlrs or 47 cts in the quarter. Losses in the nine months were reduced to 32.7 mln dlrs or 44 cts from 84.4 mln dlrs or one dlr. Sales grew 23.5 pct in the quarter to 398.1 mln dlrs and 25.5 pct in the nine months to 1.36 billion dlrs. Bookings recovered in the latter part of the third quarter, the company said. Despite the improvement in order rates and operating results year-to-year, pricing continues to be "aggressive for many products," it said. Nevertheless, it expects the semiconductor business will continue to improve this year. The Information Systems Group will continue strong sales growth based on recent order trends and new product introductions, it said. Reuter 

Kansas Republican Congressman Pat Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union. Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union. Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country. "That very well may be the case," said Tom Kay, U.S. Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge. Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow. "I'd be delighted to deliver the message," Kay replied.

Diversified investment company, <Ariadne Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares in the Philippine brewing firm <San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper reported. The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the government. The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in Manila were not available for comment on the report. The shares are the entire block seized by the government from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president Ferdinand Marcos. The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14 mln class B shares. Government officials have said earlier that the more valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners. The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might buy eight mln class A shares last week. "Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the Philippines' yearly budget," Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday. "Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so that the company's assets can be fully utilised." San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of the major manufacturers of grocery lines. Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through <Barwon Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity. Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover of about two billion, has interests also in mining, real estate and agricultural products. REUTER 

Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would succeed in restricting money growth. In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid Assets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of 17 pct in March, the same as in February. The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987 is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year. Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range. He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct real drop in the contribution of the external sector. The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said. REUTER 

But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to reclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension of direct interest payments on medium- and long-term loans. "The corporation believes that it is premature to make a decsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt as nonperforming at this time," First Interstate said. But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension of interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its loans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaning that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted from net income and interest would no longer be accrued. Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstate said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade lines in Brazil.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets. She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case. "I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is," Thatcher said. Thatcher told Parliament that "shortly ... We shall have more powers than we have now, when, for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available, then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do." Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa. But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company. REUTER 

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said, noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to move over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention. They said that due to the dispute between the Commission and producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences on a large tonnage. The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise level after prices fell yesterday. Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus. Last week, the Commission granted licences to end August on 60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819. REUTER 

Financial and industrial holding company Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of 400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said. He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two week, when terms would set according to market conditions. He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new investments. Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25 francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985. Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against 147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake. Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit before provisions of around 135 mln francs. REUTER 

Schweizerische Aluminimum AG <ALUZ.Z> (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said. "The threshold of profitability has returned to the foreseeable future," he said. "We expect already in 1987 approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that our industrial environment does not worsen." He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past losses. Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986 after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985. Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion. Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for 1985. But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news conference the new management installed a year ago had decided to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an asset. Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from 472 mln in 1985. It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining, after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in 1985. Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from 1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a 50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22. Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this "radical elimination of the mortgages of the past" painful, but said the foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy. Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56 billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion. Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111 mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct in 1985. In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of Switzerland <SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp <SBVZ.Z> and Credit Suisse <CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a subordinated loan. The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987. Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts. That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169 mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a 479 mln loss instead of 179 mln. The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of 1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar alternations were made for previous years. After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895 mln francs. REUTER 

Southwestern Bell Corp said that its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging systems, including those of <Metromedia Inc>, will result in some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio. In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some 1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level within an acceptable range. In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from 43.7 pct in 1985. In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26 dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion dlrs. Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of investment tax credits. By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and cash flow. In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct increase in long distance calling volumes. Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which expenditures were held below budget. Reuter 

Zaire agreed to limit its tin exports to 1,736 tonnes for 12 months from March 1 in line with an Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) plan to curb exports, the ATPC said. ATPC Executive Director Victor Siaahan told Reuters he received a telex from Zaire indicating its willingess to take part in the plan to limit total ATPC exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March 1. Siaahan said Zaire is expected to produce 1,900 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987, and that in 1986 its output and exports were about 1,200 tonnes. The ATPC hopes to cut the 70,000-tonne world surplus by 20,000 tonnes and boost prices. All ATPC members except Zaire and Australia recently agreed to adhere to the export quotas allocated them under the plan. Australia said its quota of 7,000 tonnes was roughly equal to its expected output this year. The ATPC consists of Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bolivia, Australia, Nigeria and Zaire.

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year. "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget. Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip. The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said. "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business," Yeutter said. "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he added. Reuter 

"The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations," Lefebvre said.

Zimbabwean officials were not immediately available for comment. The ban will affect products such as uncanned meat, milk, ham, butter and bacon, BOPA reported.

Brazil's state-oil company, Petrobras, cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from Saudi Arabia after the Saudis refused to accept credit guarantees from the Bank of Brazil, a Petrobras official said. Export director Carlos Santana told a press conference the Saudis were the first suppliers of oil to impose such conditions after Brazil's decision to halt interest payment of its commercial debts last month. The shipment of 2.2 mln barrels represents two days of oil consumption in Brazil. But Santana said if the Saudis change their minds and decide to respect the terms of the contract, then Petrobras will lift the order to cancel the shipment. Santana said if the Saudis do not accept Brazil's terms by Monday then Petrobras will negotiate elsewhere. "Petrobras has been Saudi Arabia's traditional client since 1955. If they do not accept our conditions now, it will be much better for us, because with the market prices more or less the same, buying from Iraq and China is an advantage," he said. Iraq and China have barter deals with Brazil, importing Brazilian goods in exchange for oil, but the Saudis buy nothing from Brazil, he said. Santana said despite a strike threat by oil industry workers and a two-week stoppage by Brazilian seamen, Petrobras oil stocks are "reasonably balanced." Saudi Arabia is Brazil's second biggest oil supplier, with an average 115,000 bpd. Iraq is the main supplier with 235,000 bpd. China comes third, with 58,000 bpd. "If the Saudis wish to stop our trade relationship, fine, I am sure that if they do, we will be getting dozens of offers from elsewhere," Santana added. Reuter 

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations. Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations. Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40. "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates," Sumita said. The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said. The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.

Papua New Guinea (PNG) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production, energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here. The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Fesharaki, leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii, was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook. With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991, PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter, Fesharaki said. The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG. The PNG government's Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels. PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes, Fesharaki said. "We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea, and discovery of much larger volumes of oil, similar in quality to (light) Bass Strait crude," Fesharaki said. There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced, notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd, he said. But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field, he said. The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG. REUTER 

Johnson and Johnson said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has notified the company its food additive petition for a high-intensity sweetener has been formally accepted and now will be reviewed by the agency. The company said the product, with the generic name of sucralose, is made from sugar and tastes like sugar, but is about 600 times sweeter. It yields no calories and does not promote tooth decay. Johnson and Johnson said the sweetner is being jointly developed with Tate and Lyle PLC <TATL>. Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United Kingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said. The company noted its petition covering the product and its safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month. While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil Specialty Products Co subsidiary. Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the discovery of Sucralose in 1976. Patents and licensing agreements control the use of sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said. Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar. The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not broken during digestion or metabolism. Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories. Reuter 

The United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade, especially over semiconductors, Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy U.S. Super-computers, and barriers to U.S. Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said. He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks. European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT. Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes. New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked. The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts. Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years. "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is, maybe, five or six years in the future." He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago. "That's a very healthy development," he added."If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist." "Members of Congress, that is the contemplative members of Congress, have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit," Yeutter said. "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and, in my judgement, more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago." He added, "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter." REUTER 

Royal Bank of Canada's <RY> small Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada (Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada, Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said. "They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the Canadian market because it's an untapped market," Brennan told reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of Commerce. Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like paper machinery and ships to Canada. He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an agreement reached in January with international financial authorities. Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada reached about 700 mln dlrs. Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986 ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much because of the country's uncertain financial climate. Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although <Bank of Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said. Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a position to resume debt repayments within a year. Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada. Reuter 

The chairman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee said the Transportation Department was allowing too many airline mergers and proposed its authority be transfered to the Justice Department. "The Transportation Department's antitrust enforcement has been disastrous, permitting rampant merger mania," Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum said in a statement. "The nine largest airlines now control 94 per cent of the market. That's bad for competition and bad for the consumer," he said. Metzenbaum said he introduced a bill to transfer antitrust authority over airline mergers to the Justice Department in hopes it would more restrictive than the Transportation Department. Reuter 

China and the European Community (EC) signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here. Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC's external relations commissioner, Willy De Clercq, signed the accord. EC sources said the office was likely to open in the second half of this year. In 1986 the EC was China's third largest trading partner, with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs. De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China's trade deficit with the EC.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies, but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim. Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans, Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen, they said. News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month, more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier. It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips. Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term, the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth. But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day. Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate. But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan. Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed, Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures. He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans, without losing face in parliament over the budget, political analysts said. Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations, deregulation, measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices, and accelerated public investment. They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half, probably over 80 pct. Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan, who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit. To complement the short-term measures, Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans. A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington. Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy, officials said. While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible, they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations. A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring, officials said. The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output, or gross national product, around 1993 or 1995. Last year the surplus, which measures trade in goods and services, amounted to over four pct of gnp. The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen, to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993, from 150 now.

USX Corp chairman David Roderick said the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc <BP> about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses. "We have terminated our discussions," Roderick told Reuters after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other possible buyer of its energy assets. Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the Standard Oil Co's <SRD> publicly held stock. USX said in December the company had held formal discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of interest from a half dozen other oil companies. Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas. "We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field during these difficult times," Roderick added. In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested Holmes a Court was buying additional shares. Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold a sizable interest in the company. "Mr. Ichan still apparently has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any," Roderick said. "He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I talk with him monthly." In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986. "I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net trade surplus," Roderick said. "I think the worst is over and we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead." However, the USX chairman warned that European trading partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. "Some economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States to our friends, trading partners and allies." Reuter 

Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it. Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact, Nazer said. The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October, said: "I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting will take place as scheduled." Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements. "We've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified," he said. OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact. Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline. Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price. "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement," he said. Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating storage, Nazer said. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC. "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability," he said. Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of "swing producer" within OPEC. Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states. "Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC," Nazer said. Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd. But he said if circumstances changed "I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures." Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer. Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year. "We did not ask any country to do anything. These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions," Nazer said. He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate -- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit. 

West German retailers expect another good year in 1987 even though they will not be able to repeat the sharp increase in turnover they enjoyed in 1986, the General Association of the German Retail Trade (HDE) said. HDE President Wolfgang Hinrichs said retailers would be satisfied with a real turnover increase of between 2.5 pct to three pct in 1987 after last year's steep 3.7 pct rise. Hinrichs said the 1986 turnover increase had brought the first hesitant signs of improvement in earnings in the West German retail sector. REUTER 

The group's other three divisions -- specialty steel, capital goods and trading -- had made a profit so far in 1986/87, he added.

In 1985/86 Thyssen's world group profit fell to 370.1 mln marks from 472.4 mln in 1984/85, reflecting costs linked to its steel operations. The company's dividend was an unchanged five marks.

Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said. A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements. Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets. The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over. The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln. Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.

Dealers saw the dollar staying at current levels but possibly rising above 1.83 marks on any supporting remarks emerging from the meetings. "But the dollar's medium-term direction is soft," one dealer said. The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the U.K.'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said. Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling's rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday's 2.910. The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for the next days, dealers said. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from this morning, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-11/16 pct.

The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally." Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process," the aide to Lyng said. "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight," said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm, basic, factual economics." Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

Finance and economy ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) opened a two- day meeting to discuss further economic integration, officials said. They said issues to be discussed by the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) would include a recommendation by central bank governors on a common currency exchange rate. The governors agreed in January on a denominator on which to base currencies of the six states. Any decision will be forwarded for final approval to a GCC summit meeting due in Saudi Arabia late this year. The six states have different currency systems. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the UAE are linked in theory to the International Monetary Fund's basket of currencies -- the special drawing right (SDR) -- but in practice to the dollar. Oman links its currency formally to the dollar, while Kuwait pegs its dinar to a trade-weighted basket devised by itself. The denominator chosen by central bank governors has not been disclosed, but some bankers expect the currencies to be linked to the SDR or a trade-weighted basket. Opening the meeting, Ahmed al-Tayer, the UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, said implementation of joint economic agreements "is increasingly linking the interests of GCC citizens together."

A spokesman said Alcan was closing the smelter, with annual capacity of 44,000 tonnes and 320 employees, because of high electricity costs and the low world market price of aluminium. Alkan had said earlier this year it would close half the plant's capacity but decided to shut down completely when talks with potential cooperation partners failed, the spokesman said.

Rumors that New York investor Asher Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid's stock higher, traders said. Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2. "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced today," one trader said. Edelman had no comment on the rumors. A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company. "There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said. Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement. The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman said. Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing. Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today from some optimism concerning new products the company is currently working on. "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new product spurred some speculation about their products," he said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview. "But there has to be a clear indication that they are willing to act," he said. Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are problems "they have brought on themselves." The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today. "Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan," he said. "My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan." The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny fraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S. Even so, Reagan's decision "doesn't give us any joy. We don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to," Yeutter said. Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include "some difficult items on the agenda." Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said. Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries, undercutting U.S. Products, he said.

Moderate to heavy rain continued over early double-crop rice areas in eastern Guangxi, Guanghdong, eastern Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang in the week ended March 28, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency said The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisture for early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas, and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have washed out some rice fields requiring replanting. Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil moisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start due to earlier dryness, it said. In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat in the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing crop moisture requirements, it said.

International transactions of non-banks again led to a significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said. Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1 billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise. But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said. Outstanding bank credits to companies and private individuals remained virtually unchanged in February. A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities. At the end of February total bank credits to the private sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level. The effect of public authority cash movements on the money supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said. Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial banks and the Bundesbank. Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money supply growth to a larger extent than in January. A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month. REUTER 

Endotronics Inc said it expects to incur "substantial losses" for the second quarter ending March 31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987. As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <Yamaha Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note. In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year. Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp <CZ>. The company said its ability to obtain funding was adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against three officers of Endotronics. Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges violations of the federal securities laws in connection with statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports. The company also said the Securities Division of the Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by insiders and brokers in the company's common shares. It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said. As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the various investigations concerning insider trading, the company said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the United States.

A meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European Community, U.S. trade officials said. Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting, which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank, to continue diplomatic pressure on EC member states. "We (all agencies) are together on this," said one U.S. trade official. One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax "there will be a great cost." U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate, has yet been drawn up. "I don't think we're at that point yet," said one trade official, adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package. Suzanne Early, assistant trade representative, told Reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue. Asked about retaliation, she said "sometimes its better not to be specific." U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax. Reuter 

The Agriculture Department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said. "We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing," said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations. U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement. But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes. "If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this," he said. Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system. "We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy," he said. "If we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made." Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates. He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week. Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums. He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease. The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices. When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea. He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied by the end of March. Reuter 

The plant will use a chemical process called leaching to extract the residual gold, which could not otherwise be economically recovered.

Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint Malaysian/Singapore currency, he added. The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of price ranges -- the "may sell" and "may buy" points at plus and minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the "must sell" and "must buy" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it. Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that were set in the present accord. "The most important of these are to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between demand and supply," he said. The buffer stock remains the sole instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto added. At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference price. It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals. The extent of the adjustment was also modified. Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator price has been above the upper intervention ("may sell") price (currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower intervention price ("may buy") price (171 cents at present) for six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides. Under the new pact, the adjustment under these circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a higher adjustment. Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to 300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher percentage. Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference price and the "lower indicative price" (or floor price) of 150 cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes. The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend. Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of the new pact. On the question of conditions for entry into force of the new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became operational. The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct. Reuter 

Japanese crushers have bought some 214,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for late April/early July shipment and may buy up to 140,000 to 190,000 tonnes more for June to August shipment, trade sources said. Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show. The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S. Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there. The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April 20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July shipment, the sources said. As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this shipment has already been purchased, the sources added. They said crushers bought some 270,000 to 280,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for April shipment. REUTER 

Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S. officials said. The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics firm. The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering. In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus. The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies. Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S. manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese government-run agencies and universities.

The 1.4 mln tonnes capacity bauxite refinery at Paranam in Surinam, which closed at the end of January after being sabotaged by anti-government rebels, has now reopened, a spokesman for Dutch metals company Billiton said. The refinery is run by Suralco, jointly owned by the U.S. Company Alcoa and the Dutch company Billiton, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell. Production of alumina at the refinery is currently running at around 3,000 tonnes a day and is expected to get back to full capacity of 4,000 tonnes within a week, the Billiton spokesman added. The refinery was forced to close at the end of January when rebels cut the main power line. Earlier, the refinery had had to import some supplies of bauxite, as rebel activity shut off supplies from Alcoa's mine at Moengo in the east of the country. Billiton's mine at Onverdacht, between Paranam and the capital Paramaribo, is still working but Moengo remains closed and the refinery is continuing to import some bauxite, the Billiton spokesman said.

Petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting. Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel. "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong," Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said. Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report. Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot. Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said. Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher. Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies. In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year. Monday's report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower. Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week. The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said. Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies. Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals. However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year. New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said. Reuter 

Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each. In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended. Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and is Caesars' largest shareholder. Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc <CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel. For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a year before. For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs. MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board. MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM> has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction. It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>, has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing. MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition, since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared. In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board, a request that has not yet been granted. In September 1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of <Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct. Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past." Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat. "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice, you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration," he said. Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him. "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck. MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.

Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to discuss oil prices and the general market situation, Iranian officials accompanying him said. He will meet UAE President Sheikh Zaid bin Sultan al-Nahayan and Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba. Aqazadeh arrived last night after a brief stopover in Riyadh, where he met Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazir. The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good. Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices. OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8 mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1. Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, quoted him as saying before leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make oil prices permanently stable. REUTER 

Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit, analysts said. "In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesses," said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit, which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs. Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the offering goes." Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2 mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs. Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it. "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating income, making it an attractive buy to a third party," Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said. On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8 mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share. About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson. Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally spokesperson said. Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long range prospects. "The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle," said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes. In addition, "the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry," said one analyst. There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding clubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry. Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the nation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, "no one has the money to offer to buy it." "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization," said Wayne LaChapelle, chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation's second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time."

U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand situation has become more bullish recently because of developments in the world market and increased consumption. Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook. He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union. "It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption to be in far better balance than a year ago," Amstutz said. Reuter 

Kampuchea harvested more than two mln tonnes of rice paddy in 1986, up on the crops of the previous two years, the official SPK news agency said yesterday. Diplomats said estimates put the 1985 harvest at less than one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984. SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln tonnes this calendar year. Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the minimum its 7.5 mln people need. REUTER 

Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis. In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries. He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem. "We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform," Dawkins said. The Venice summit is scheduled for June. He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system. Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes. "We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice." The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years, he said.

Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record 221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous year. Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels. He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified amount from 1985's record levels. Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from 9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10 billion this year. Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi would ensure VW got a share of profits. Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend. Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models. As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct to 59,800 last year. Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom out in 1987. Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000. Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000, but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180 in 1985. Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to 57,000. Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen compared with 1985's 392,000. Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to further new hiring of employees. At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record 39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985. REUTER 

Cyclops Corp said its board rejected a request by Cyacq Corp, an investor group, for more non-public information about Cyclops, a maker of specialty steels and an electronics retailer. Cyclops cited its agreement to be acquired by Britain's Dixons Group PLC for 90.25 dlrs a share under a tender offer that expires midnight March 17. Cyacq, comprising Audio/Video Affiliates Inc, Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd and other investors, yesterday said it would increase its tender offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs a share from 80 dlrs, subject to certain conditions. The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq with non-public data given to Dixons and that Cyacq be satisfied with financial projections made by Dixons in its offer. Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacq's announcement was not an offer. "Cyacq's press release does not amend Cyacq's outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrs per share and it does not state that Cyacq has financing commitments necessary to carry out its original offer or any increased offer that it may make," Cyclops said in a statement. Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicated it will not rescind or waive any provisions of the pacts, Cyclops said. The company also said it was advised that Dixons' shareholders approved the merger, satisfying that condition of the agreement. Reuter 

CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its <Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs. The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint statement. The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement. Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects. In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's interests in the next two years, the statement said. "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement. Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier, he said. As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.

Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's securities repurchase agreement, dealers said. But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week. A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow. The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured. Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks. The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed. Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week. Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March. Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March. No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week, but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tighten. "The Bundesbank wants to keep rates around 3.80 pct," one dealer said. REUTER 

The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said. The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct. An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy. The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly. New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984. Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement." Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter. Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct. The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant. The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment. The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies. Reuter 

On Dec 31, 1986, Newmont said, Magma had about 85.0 mln dlrs of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in 1999-2000 and about 4.0 mln dlrs of investment tax credit carryover expiring in 2000-2001. Newmont said Magma has pre-tax losses of 290 mln dlrs during the 1981 through 1985 period, noting the five major U.S. primary copper producers reported aggregate pre-tax losses of 1.9 billion dlrs during five year period. Newmont said Magma had total sales of 347.3 mln dlrs last year, including copper sales of 293.4 mln dlrs. It said the copper sales value was up from 267.6 mln dlrs in 1985 reflecting a 10.1 pct increase in quantity sold to 212,000 short tons and a 0.4 pct decrease in price. Reuter 

Dry weather covered most European crop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those in southwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency said mixed rain and snow covered Greece. Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March. Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in early April, it said. Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said. Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by late April. Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India, reversing February's below-normal trend. Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most southern areas, it said. In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon and southern Mindanao. Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands. In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding in Java, it said. The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said. Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet crop demands, it said. Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained adequate moisture for crop growth, it said. Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase, the agency said. Reuter 

Japan is sending a three-man team to Washington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions that officials warn could spark a wave of anti-U.S. Sentiment here. The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergency talks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter row over trade in computer microchips, officials said. "The sanctions are against the free trade system," Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters, adding: "If these measures are taken, the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would become not so good as before." Other officials were more blunt. "The U.S. Action will have a significant impact on the growing anti-U.S. Feeling (here)," another MITI official said. A senior Foreign Ministry official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters the U.S. Threats have undercut those in the government who argue for conciliation. "There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally, why should we bother doing anything," he said. "Anything we do, we will be bashed." The senior official sounded pessimistic about the likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing U.S. Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington on April 29. "I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden (by the visit)," he said. Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of measures to President Reagan to help contain U.S. Frustration over Japan's large trade surplus. But the senior official played down those expectations. REUTER 

Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in 1985. The company said that its 1986 performance was best reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln from 221 mln in 1985. Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a trading and industrial company. In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in 1985. REUTER 

A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system. Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate." His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports. Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress. De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks. Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs. Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods. Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs. "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he said. Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes. He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards. "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion." Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines." He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better." He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices. He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?" reuter 

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said. "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers. Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement. Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90 yesterday. REUTER 

Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said. Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain. By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed. If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis. "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest. "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market. The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage. Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date been exchanged for grain. With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said. A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said. Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted. The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said. "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports," which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said. But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system. Reuter 

A leading U.S. farm-state Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year. "We're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program)," Rep. Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject. Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons. "I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work," he said. "Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are," said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress. A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said. A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said. "I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program)," Huckaby said. However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said. He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U.S. But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced. Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon. "This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved," Huckaby said. Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls. Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production. "I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?" he said. Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said "You build a fragile house if you do it that way." Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain. But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy. Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year. Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program. "The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't think it will get up a head of steam," Huckaby said. He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved. Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market. Reuter 

Deutsche Babcock AG <DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year ending September 9 although the earnings level is still unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said. He told a news conference that business during the year had weakened somewhat but was still generally positive. Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26 billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period. However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when current orders from major projects are booked. Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end- February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks. Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at 8.64 billion marks. Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks. Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks. Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the current business year, with financial reserves in the first five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86. He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.

Kenya's economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, Planning Minister Robert Ouko said. He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors. Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector. The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added. "Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987," the planning minister said. "High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade liberalisation and disciplined financial management are expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector," he said. Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February, the minister added. Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now. Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops increased during the second half of last year. Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period, he said. Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy and promised to improve government cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact with them. "I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same period the previous year," he said. Ouko said the "one stop" bureau was intended to stimulate investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved in processing applications. The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier. This was owing to higher agricultural production and the Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major currencies, the report said. The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during the period. This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of 780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period, compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in the second half of 1985, it said.

"We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do more," he said. Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production. However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures. The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It suggested options for the administration to consider, but made no specific recommendations. Reuter 

From October 1, no direct trade would be allowed in either direction, with certain exceptions covering medical supplies and printed matter, Gradin told a news conference. She said exceptions would also be granted in cases where a Swedish trade boycott would benefit South African firms and disadvantage South Africa's black-ruled neighbours, the front-line states.

Swissair <SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that, in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut its payout to 33 francs per share from 38. President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate. The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of 27 mln francs the previous year, he said. The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68 mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20 mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s. Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276 mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation. Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45 mln francs supplementary depreciation. Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc. While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc against other European currencies. "Income and profit generated by services to these countries shrank by a very substantial margin," he said. "Exchange rate trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other airlines."

He said Shintaro Abe, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's executive council chairman, would propose some unspecified measures in response to demands to ease import controls on U.S. Farm products. Kato declined to give any details. REUTER 

Cuban president Fidel Castro told a Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule. In a speech Sunday, published in today's official paper GRANMA, Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the central and western parts of the island. The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were particularly "vulnerable," as muddy fields prevent operations. Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign. However, a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year's 7.2 mln tonnes. Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest was 8.2 mln tonnes. The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June, the official said. Reuter 

Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market. The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990. Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty. Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI, suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops. He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear completely." He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies. REUTER 

Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said. Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said. But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said. "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said. The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said. "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said. The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said. With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower. Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination. "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said. Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said. Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said. Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said. "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said. But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said. Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said. "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half," Martell said. Reuter 

The Commodity Credit Corporation has approved an additional 45.0 mln dlrs under its interemdiate export credit guarantee program, GSM-103, for sales of U.S. wheat to Morocco, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The action increases Morocco's cumulative fiscal year 1987 program for wheat under GSM-103 to 75.0 mln dlrs. The credit terms extended for exports under the program must be in excess of three years but no more than seven years to eligible for credit coverage. All sales under this line must be registered and exported by September 30, 1987. The department also said the guarantee line for sales of U.S. wheat under the Export Credit Guarantee Program, GSM-102, has been decreased 45.0 mln dlrs to 60.0 mln. Reuter 

Striking seamen said they would offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management's terms. The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress. President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday. Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood. One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country's main ports. The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get, and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports. An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read, "The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational and unpatriotic." The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month. At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with allowances. "Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world, after Ghana's," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that. REUTER 

South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuters that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced, he said "yes, I think so." Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen. He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan. Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods. He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation. Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions." But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons." Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot of concessions already." He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents. Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs. Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation." South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods, such as television sets, video cassette records and personal computers. Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton. The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs, four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs. Reuter 

He declined comment on local press reports that U.S. Lines planned to suspend operations because of failure to restructure its 1.27 billion U.S. Dlr debt, but said the firm would make an announcement later today. U.S. Lines filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter Eleven of the U.S. Federal law last November. The English-language South China Morning Post said U.S. Lines decided yesterday to sell its two remaining transpacific service fleets and assets and those of its U.S.-South America operation. It quoted a letter by company's chief executive Charles Hiltzheimer that said the ships and assets will be bought by rival U.S. Shipping companies, subject to approval by their boards. U.S. Lines' Far East operations comprise offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Busan, Seoul, Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe and Osaka, Burnside said. REUTER 

The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said. Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington. It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar. Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a "vague statement," casting doubt on operators' assumptions that a secret target level had been set. Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, "there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar." One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. "They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative," he said. Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's undertone. Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said. After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said. "We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies," the U.S. Bank dealer said. Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later. The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy. Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment. Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480. The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100. REUTER 

World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world. But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war. Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth. "We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time," he said. He said the U.S. action against Japan was "a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy." The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched. He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform. The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy. "We're comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio," Conable said. He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time. He noted, "the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt." Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank. Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks. He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency. the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities. "I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow," Conable said. However, he said "I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose." He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis. Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues. On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that "I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development." He added, "so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution." On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa. Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week's meetings. Reuter 

The U.S. Will pursue its complaint that European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft committee, a GATT spokesman said today. The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) during a special two-day session ending today. GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce. The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S. Complaint, starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in July, trade officials said. "The tension has eased," the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters. "The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels." U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus, voiced during a visit to European capitals in February. In a letter calling for the special committee meeting, Washington charged France, West Germany, the U.K., Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus. The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view. Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices. Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating. All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings. Reuter 

Brisk increases in personal income and consumption are to appear in February data released today, but the bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than expected, economists said. Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct, compared with no change in January, while consumption expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct, reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January. M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage and salary disbursements in February. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added. The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct. Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow range, desperately seeking direction. "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond market," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations that inflation will remain subdued. But he warned that this assumption might not be justified. "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five pct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in a report. After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct. Reuter 

Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said. He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries. The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added. It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said. Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions. "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic," Dauster added. He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement. "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said. Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas. "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover," he said. The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said. Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries. Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present. He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has been abandoned." Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened. He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested. He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags. He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April. Reuter 

Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time. She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said. Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively. Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January. European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles. Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way. "The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion," she said. However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said. She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well. REUTER 

The U.S. Agriculture Department said an announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln dlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S. commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies. First, the USDA said its announcement should not have said that plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in GSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber. The original announcement said the guarantees included three mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood. Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales, but that "it's possible it would be." Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product. Members states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer concessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said. However, the Reagan administration is considering whether to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee program, Sims said. Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers. In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow is available only for public sector importers, Walter Stern, Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said. Reuter 

The Bank of England does not favour the introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said. Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual dinner. Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in. "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators, for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all, the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said. He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested," he said. Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a company's management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said. Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market, and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he said. In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest, be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result." They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added. REUTER 

A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here. A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference. Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said. The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said. He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct. "The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs," Story said. Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said. The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure. REUTER 

Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with Chemical New York Corp <CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs. Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected earnings to increase. "We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement over last because we are stronger," Love said, referring to Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical. The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15 basis points, Love said. The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved interstate banking effective January 1. Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas' struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc <ALBN> lost 17.6 mln dlrs, MCorp <M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5 mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation <FBT>, which is actively seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln dlrs. Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987. "I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us," he said. "The fact that the real estate market is still moving away suggests there could be some continuing growth of nonperforming loans." In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43 pct. More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans, which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln dlrs the year before, were in real estate. Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about 30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four years, he said. "I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a barrel," he said. Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to build up its consumer banking business, Love said. "We are resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position," he said. In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area, and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member banks, he said. One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced in December, InterFirst Corp <IFC> and RepublicBank Corp <RPT>, both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued at 570 mln dlrs. The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. "We think we can try to get a little part of their roost," he said. The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an edge in developing new consumer products, he said. "We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products," he said, referring to expansion of such existing products as credit cards and investment banking. Reuter 

The U.K. Longer leading cyclical indicator rose in February by 5.8 pct after January's 1.9 pct rise, figures from the Central Statistical Office show. The indicator, base 1980, which shows trends in the economy 12 months ahead, was put at 108.7 in February compared with 102.7 in January and 99.5 in February 1986. The shorter leading indicator, signalling trends six months ahead, was put at 97.1 for January, the latest month for which data were available, after December's 96.5. This compared with 98.4 in January 1986. The coincident indicator, designed to signal current turning points in the economy, was put at 91.2 in January, down from 91.9 in December and 91.6 in january 1986. The lagging index, which the CSO says shows a turning point in the economy about a year after it happens, was at 92.4 in January, down from 92.5 in December and 93.0 a year earlier. The Office said leading indicators still do not show a consistent picture of the likely future developments of the business cycle in Britain. It said the strong rise in the longer leading index between December and February was due mainly to rises in share prices. REUTER 

It said the payments were suspended because of certain covenants contained in its loan agreements. A spokesman said the company's loss of 2,115,000 dlrs for the first 11 months as a public company did not meet an income condition on the loans, leading to the suspension. The maker of foam cups, food containers and other products said it had 733,332 outstanding preferred shares, which had been privately placed. The dividend payments on the shares amounted to 1,045,000 dlrs per year, the spokesman said. Reuter 

Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct. Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism. But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme. "It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly," Massy-Green said.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual meeting, the company said. Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of silver to Placer, Equity said. Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000 ounce minimum commitment for 1987. Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to Placer. Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said. It also said the stock and silver transactions will create a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when cash is available. The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the company said. It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might be paid. The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver said.

The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd <RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open for an extra five years following a new aid package from the state government, RGC said in a statement. The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40 series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994. The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said. Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000 tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said. The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast of Tasmania. The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10 mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions and deferred royalties and payroll taxes. REUTER 

Less than two months after First Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy, but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought. In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991, "so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our independence, if possible." In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major East Coast banks to buy banks in California. First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western states and has franchise operations in four additional states. Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the lucrative California market and the West Coast region. While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied, "That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive not to think that." Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as "opportunistic". He said he will look for banks in management trouble that he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate already operates, then cut costs by combining resources. The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased at a discount because of the depressed regional economy. Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "We continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of people continue to monitor and look at us." Banking analysts, however, consider another First Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen any time soon. Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25 billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very, very difficult decision." With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number four position in the California banking community. "The competition in this state is tough," he said, noting CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches from Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to move us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said. Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona, Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated. "Security is, has been and continues to be a highly profitable and obviously well managed company," he said. He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional banks a common name. Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy, real estate and agriculture dominate the economy. Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked, he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think most of the problems are real estate-related and the real estate problems are going to be with us for several years." Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's franchise operation. First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First Interstate financial services in ten states. While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into the Midwest must come first. Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable," Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of the agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed we were generating before the last year or two." On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks 1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits. Reuter 

Coleco Industries Inc said it expects to return to profitability in 1987. Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln dlrs in the year earlier. In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln dlrs to 230 mln dlrs. Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a more diversified organization through four major acquisitions last year. Products from the new acquisitions and other new product introductions are expected to enable it to return to profitability, it said. At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month, vice president Morton Handel said analysts' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable. Reuter 

Turkey's Gross National Product grew an estimated 8.0 pct in 1986 at fixed 1968 prices, compared with 5.1 pct in 1985, the State Statistics Institute said. Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth both at 7.9 pct. The government's GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct, the same level it had set for 1986. The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6 dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985. Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled municipal expenditures in the early part of the year. Industry grew at 11.1 pct in real terms in 1986 compared with 6.6 pct in 1985 while agriculture expanded 7.4 pct compared with 2.8 pct. REUTER 

Production in the manufactured goods industry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by between one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in 1986, the Ifo economic institute said. An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting the engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of two to three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986. Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharply for capital goods in the electronics sector, it added. Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in 1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose 5.1 pct. Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct last year, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.

A strong performance by its retail businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in 1986, stock analysts said. They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln in 1985. The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a share in 1985. James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's 1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income to retail sales. Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow. Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465 mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985. But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35 pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG> will fall to about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985. The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong Kong Land of <Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September. Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the year as part of its retail business, which will increase its overall retail income figures. Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct share of <Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>. Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986 of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985. Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs. But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said. Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its diverse interests. It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest. A company statement issued last month said the firm will use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand. Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is likely to develop its own business, analysts said. "The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability to creatively structure some new acquisitions," said Hargreaves of Hoare Govett. He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its existing business. REUTER 

Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's council of economic advisors, said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines. "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation," he told the Futures Industry Association. Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period. "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery," he said. Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed Japan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, "Not enough to sustain employment growth." However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax reform. "I suspect there will be further moves," he said. Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases. "Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform," he said, adding that "a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform." Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated. However, he said that "sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable," as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad. "I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987," he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present "serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners." Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said. He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them. Reuter 

The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution. The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs. Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution. The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership. Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960. But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark. With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op. Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc. Illinois Co-op's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis. Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system. Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade. Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said. Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago. "The period we've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch," he said. "There's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops." One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits. But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served "to make folks gun-shy," Hanes said. Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics. A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm "was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business." "We're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside," he said. "But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms." Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative. "In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings," he said but added, "The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around." Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. "I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization." In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed. Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as "patronage refunds" to the members. Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs. "You're dealing with substantially lower volume," Mulligan said. "Lower volume translates into higher costs." According to the company's 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member's trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year. However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out. Reuter 

David Pryor, D-Ark., said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee's trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans, corn and wheat. Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel. The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports. Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees. Reuter 

Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say. "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said. The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs. Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue. This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct. But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon. Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May. One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt. Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors. With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish. Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks. The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion. The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form. Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the portfolio manager said. He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings. The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other. The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes. A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year. Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect. "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said. Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier. But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark. "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in London said. The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said. REUTER 

Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said. Export quotas -- the major device of the International Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.

Ohio Edison Co said it has completed the sale and leaseback of 30 pct of its 30 pct interest in Unit One of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest. The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205 megawatt generating plant was sold to a group of institutional investors which leased it back to the company for a period of about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate. Ohio Edison said the proceeds will be used to finance the rest of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high-interest long-term debt. Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said the "payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company will need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates into savings for our customers." The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year. It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the investors because they could take quicker advantage of tax benefits than the utility could. Reuter 

Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported. The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three months longer than planned. The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time, as happens now, the paper said. The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz. It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq. U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted officials as saying. From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could fire long-range missiles, the paper said. REUTER 

The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said. Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters. He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board. Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued. Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said. Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued. Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added. "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise," he said. He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation. REUTER 

Emery Air Freight Corp said it plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83 pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp. The company said the tender offer is the first step in a plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares. Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40 dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining Purolator share outstanding. On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc. Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the management-led buyout offer. In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady, Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still prefer to negotiate with Purolator. But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited tender offer of its own. Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on April 28, unless extended. The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan. Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations. Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer. It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate, payable twice a year. For the first three years after the notes are issued, interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in additional notes, Emery said. It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued. Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's management would continue with the company. "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter. He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast. Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer, which was released several hours after the stock market had closed. Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8. Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8. Reuter 

Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said. Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report. Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct. The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said. IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year. The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks. Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986. The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said. Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively. Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption. The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March. And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said. World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986. This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said. Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period. A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said. Reuter 

Bank of Boston Corp expects first quarter earnings will range between 90 cts and one dlr a share, up from 79 cts a share last year, Chairman William Brown said. He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt payments. If a default does occur, it would first quarter earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the bank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added. Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year. Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986. He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company recovers from an earthquake earlier this year. Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit problems. Brown said the Bank of Boston remains "cautiously optimitic about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be on nonaccural all year." In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs a share, or 232.8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1.08 billion dlrs. President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders's meeting the bank's total loans to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico totaled 875 mln dlrs at the end of 1986, 37 pct of its primary capital. Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs, of which about two-thirds are affected by its suspension of interest payments on its medium and long term foreign debt. Reuter 

The chairman of the U.S. Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week. The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty, social programs, agricultural marketing systems, the auto industry and Canada's cultural identity. Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries, which are each other's largest trading partners. "We need a truly free trade agreement, which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive, a large agreement," the Texas Democrat said in a statement. "I do not question Canada's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity. However, if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations, I am deeply concerned," he added. Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods. He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction, it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval. "I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister (Brian) Mulroney next month, he will be presented with this kind of argument, and I hope he makes it clear -- as I did when I was in Canada -- that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successful," Bentsen said. Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in Ottawa. Bentsen urged Mulroney to withdraw a proposal that would ban imports of independently produced films into Canada by non-Canadians, which the senator called a protectionist measure. Reuter 

The Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been set yet, industry sources said. Production prices, the basis for setting intervention prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said. Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values, the sources added. In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers. The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market. The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is 1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said. The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760. They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market. Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices, they said.

The world's dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview. "Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable," McIvor said. Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said. McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding. "Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year," McIvor said. "The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity," he added. McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 "one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered." McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more "super giants", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency. "Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)." McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies. "The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies," McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy. Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but "the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production." McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs. "Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply," McIvor said. "Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel," he added. Reuter 

The White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement, industry sources said. They would give no details, noting that the White House had not commented on the decision. The administration has been under pressure to retaliate. There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision, but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices. U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so, after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation. The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors. Under a pact reached last July, Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors. In return, the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments. The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries, and that the Japanese market remains closed. The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors. A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union. U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods, such as televisions, video cassette recorders and computers. REUTER 

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, "we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to." When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said "I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. "It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented," Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's current level, adding that "It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level." He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. "There has been a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals," Lawson said. He disagreed with what he termed "the grossly exaggerated claim" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that "over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation." He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP "is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine." He added that "to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation." Reuter 

"So long as there is an external imbalance there will be trade friction and ...Harsh words between the two governments," the Foreign Ministry official told reporters. Last year, Japan racked up a 51.5 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon. Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods, raising the spectre of a trade war between the two countries. "We take the current situation very seriously," said the official, who declined to be identified. "The basic stance of the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all available resources." The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer microchips in world markets and to try to import more American semiconductors. Tokyo has denied the charges. The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs in the middle of this month. But he said that any response would be in accordance with international law and Japan's international obligations. He added that both Japan and the United States must take account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the world economy. REUTER 

"First quarter results will be dramatically better," he said following a presentation to analysts. He cited a sharp drop in non-earning assets, healthy asset growth and lower expenses. He declined to predict specific results for the first quarter. In the 1986 first quarter, the commerical finance company earned 606,000 dlrs, or eight cts per share. Gevirtz also declined to predict full year results, but said, "We expect an excellent year." In 1986 Foothill earned 3,239,000 dlrs, or 41 cts per share. Analysts expect Foothill to record earnings of 65 cts to 85 cts a share in 1987. During the presentation Gevirtz said Foothill has reduced to less than five pct the company's level of non-performing assets, which was as high as eight pct in previous years. David Hilton, chief financial officer, said the company's general and administrative expenses in 1987 will be reduced to about 3.0 to 3.5 pct of average assets from 4.3 pct in 1986.

About 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation, Comibol, declared a general strike as from midnight (0400 gmt) to press for higher salaries, a statement by the federation for Bolivian mine workers said. It said the strike was called to defend the nationalised mining industry. The miners were willing to negotiate with the government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro, but only if it showed an intention to meet the strikers' demands. The government said the strike was designed to cause it embarrassment during the four-day visit of West German President Richard Von Weizsaecker, which starts on Friday.

Yugoslavia's top oil and natural gas producer <Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern <Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said. Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France. Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs. Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> two years ago. Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects, involving Yugoslavia's other main producer <Naftagas> of Novi Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said. Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year. Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's leading export enterprises. In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there. Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest about 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area. Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the Tunisian government, has transferred one third of its option rights in the region to Ina, it said. REUTER 

Additional capital inflows of 1.5 billion dlrs so far this year have boosted Mexico's reserves to about eight billion dlrs, director of public credit Angel Gurria told reporters. Money has been coming back to Mexico because of improved investor confidence and because a tight monetray policy has forced credit-starved industries to repatriate capital. Inflows totalled a billion dlrs in fourth-quarter 1986. Gurria said Mexico is not accumulating reserves for the sake of it. He said its new loans will increase the pool of funds available for badly needed investment. Once the first tranche of its new six billion dlr loan is drawn down in the second quarter, Mexico will still only have enough reserves to pay for imports and debt service for four or five months, Gurria noted. Nevertheless, Gurria said Mexico does not expect to draw on the commercial banks' 1.2 billion dlr investment-support contingency facility. That money will be available until April 1988 if Mexico's export receipts and the price of oil fall below certain levels. But Mexico failed to qualify for the first two drawings totalling 451 mln dlrs, and Gurria said today, "We expect we'll never have to use it." Gurria said Mexico will know by June whether it can draw on the second contingency facility included in the bank financing package - a 500 mln dlr growth co-financing loan with the World Bank. Finance minister Gustavo Petricioli said he had signed yesterday a 250 mln dlr loan with the World Bank to support the development of exports of manufactured goods. He also said the first 250 mln dlr tranche of a one billion dlr loan from the Japanese government to support steel, oil and export promotion will be disbursed at the end of the month. Mexico is also due to make the third drawing from its International Monetary Fund standby credit in the next few days based on a successful review of end-1986 economic results. Petricioli said Mexico is in the final stages of discussions which will determine quantitative economic targets for 1987 which will allow it to continue to draw from the IMF for the rest of 1987. Petricioli reported that Mexico has so far concluded eight bilateral accords with government creditors within the Paris Club. Sixteen governments signed the Paris Club umbrella agreement last September, which restructured 1.8 billion dlrs of official debt, and Petricioli said he hopes to finalize pacts with the remaining eight countries in the next few weeks. In keeping with the spirit of the September agreement, he said all countries from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development have continued to provide export credit facilities for Mexico, despite the debt restructuring.

Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters. The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said. The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors. The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said. They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment. Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1. The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month, the sources said. A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness, they said. Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity. This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said. The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said. The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989. Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December, followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping. However, falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry, the sources said. Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said. The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years, the sources said. In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said. "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world," said an official at a major Japanese shipping company. The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's, has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships, and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said. REUTER 

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation to pass a protectionist trade bill this year. In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year. But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods. "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness," Rostenkowski said. "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market," he added. However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States. Reuter 

Siemens AG <SIEG.F> rebutted U.S. Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph Corp's <T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications firm <Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT. Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV <PGLO.AS> had not been decided on two years ago as claimed by AT and T. The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT. The result of the negotiations was still open. Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer. The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the U.S. Baur said he expected the French government to decide on the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct. The French government has limited CGCT participation by foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs for the whole company. Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology. Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm <Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT. Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre with was also being planned. REUTER 

Gencorp said its RKO General subsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other adjustments at closing. The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO's application to renew the station's broadcast license would be dismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television would be granted. Disney would then acquire privately held Fidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments. Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged in regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years. The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal Communications Commission, the company said. Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los Angeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp <WX> to settle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mln dlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the remainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghouse withdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it. In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC has approved the transaction, but several parties have appealed. The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals, according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp. Fidelity Television originally filed a competing application for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent station, in 1965. In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV in Boston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccurate financial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously granted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ, to be denied.

American Motors Corp said its auditors qualified the company's 1986 financial report. The report was qualified due to uncertainties surrounding the previously announced arbitration award against American Motors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is being contested. The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal to take over American Motors. American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award, made to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60 mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged the award. The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV> in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General last year sought protection under Chapter 11. The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the development of certain components in the contract. The components were for the military's "High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle" (HMMWV), American Motors said. In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the Emerson Electric claims. AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court, and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of the LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a confirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain. Reuter 

It said the debt was part of a 33.90 billion franc liability incurred through the activation of EMCF swap facilities to defend the franc before the January 11 European Monetary System realignment. The realignment, following several weeks of speculative pressure, produced a three pct revaluation of the West German mark and the Dutch guilder against the French franc and a two pct revaluation of the Belgian franc.

"If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on." Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes. China has to feed one quarter of the world's population, but only one seventh of its land is arable. Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in 1986. But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them. Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years. "We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began," official Xu said. "Since then, nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up." "Last year we lost land to a new railway line," Xu said. But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses, she added. The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year. "The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully, wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious," said an article in the official press explaining the new measures. "It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland," it said. "China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient." An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must be approved by the city government. The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making it more profitable for them to grow other crops. To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it. Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices. Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too much to the demands of "selfish city people" and could raise city grain prices without any problem. But the government has ruled out a price rise. "Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability," said a China Daily editorial this month. The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term. "We must be very careful. We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises," he said. "The problem is how to do it." The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents. In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular. The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes. Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops, but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land. "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the future," the China Daily said in an editorial last month. Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it. For most of the period of Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative. "New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment," the newspaper said. REUTER 

A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said. He said the poor results were caused by "a range of exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control" and predicted a return to profitability this year. Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business . REUTER 

Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc, which was being courted by USAir. Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid. Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment. Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over. Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged. "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager. Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed. Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance. Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought. Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont. But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies. Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA. "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager. Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer. "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said one arbitrager. Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share. Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately. "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work," said one analyst. Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions. In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said. Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work. However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA. Reuter 

Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said. He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split. The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue. Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985. Cheung Kong also reported extraordinary gains of 983.6 mln dlrs mainly from the firm's sale of the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd <HKEH.HK> for one billion dlrs. It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985. Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies. "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings." Cheung Kong is cash rich and is looking for new projects in the British colony, Li said, noting the firm is interested in a land reclamation project along the Hong Kong harbour and is exchanging views with the government on a proposal to build a second airport.

All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said. Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim Miller, president of NAWG said. "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said. Reuter 

The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing," the EIU said. "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy," it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly sick." Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986. However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said. After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said. It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986. Reuter 

World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World's sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said. Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers. He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia's largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments. Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia's most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow. Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year's crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half. Japan's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects. Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit. Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia's high-cost protected economy. "Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support," Conable said in his arrival statement. But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes. "We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed," Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport. Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World's sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968. Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more. Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government's trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth. Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment. Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia's 215 state-run companies could be sold. But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms. Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia's high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy. Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices. It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation. He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector. Indonesia's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.

The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant. The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate. Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure. USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs. The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received. To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay. USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures. The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding. In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall. Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses. The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance. USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings. USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs. USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs. In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments. But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program. Reuter 

The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs, or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating loss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous year. Hudson's Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome's 10 pct series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares. Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per share. Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes. Hudson's Bay also said its Markborough properties subsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from 98.8 mln dlrs the year before. Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs in 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago. Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs, up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were reduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion dlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1.8 to one from 2.1 to one. Reuter 

Taiwan's new controls on currency inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said. The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source. Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions. Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight, insurance and royalties, to the central bank. But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's flourishing currency black market. The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs. The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70. "I don't think the central bank has a final target," said an executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise. Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year. Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986. This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency. The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging speculators. Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable. Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level. "Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want to take the risk," said one local banker. He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem. The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue, he said. Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank. "The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation," said the manager of a European bank. Economists criticised the controls, saying they could antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan. "Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has restricted inflows," said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers da Costa. A local banker, who declined to be named, said, "It's basically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against the government's liberalisation programme." Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year.

The House Ways and Means Committee is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws. The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries. The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge. The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved. In investigations involving a processed agricultural product, trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties. The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture, seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and non-tariff barriers. President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3, 1991. The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989. It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1, 1991. Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years. Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports. Reuter 

Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. "Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape," PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. "We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change," Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. "Money seems to be chasing yields," William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a "bull flag" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. "It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout," in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. "At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25," Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. "We may still probe to see what the parameters are," Byers said, "but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene)." Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level. Reuter 

Rising imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials, but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan. Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe, as it is in the United States. But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold. The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said. But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus. "The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S.," said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London. "Basically, their policies are pretty much the same." But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically, Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said. "In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here," he added. "In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich." Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called "countervailing duties" - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair. In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said. In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade. But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers. "It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement," said Wolf. Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row. A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances. In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC. Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war, they said. Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits, cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to try to improve the situation, the diplomats said. In Britain, where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered. But government officials said last night, "We are not talking about days or weeks. This is going to take time." They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday, but added that no final decisions were expected. The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial markets, government officials said. REUTER 

The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said. Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO." Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them." Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said. REUTER 

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement. A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week. "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget." Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat. Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy. As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct. The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped. Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow. "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future. The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said. Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern. "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term," he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation. The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was "not a good budget for inflation," he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation. Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the "leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front. He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness. Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts. Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg. But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988. Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately. But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it. James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no "chickens coming home to roost." Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory. Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity. REUTER 

Tandem Computers Inc said it expects higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter ending March 31 against a year ago.

In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned 9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln dlrs. Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is traditionally slower than the first. L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned 1.44 dlrs a share. Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United States. "The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions are being made. We didn't see that a year ago," he said. The executive said Tandem will increase its research and development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986. He said the company plans to introduce several products, including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL programming language, an industry standard.

Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the tax code, but would look at the proposal. Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test, spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production. In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington's criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which may hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000. This, he said, would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption. Reuter 

The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said. A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales. Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring. One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market. A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully. But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales. "We are not legally authorized to do that," he said. A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions. REUTER 

Gold is expected to continue its rise this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said. It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growing inflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crude oil producer. Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed the central banks' limits and real growth of their gross national products, it said. Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank said. Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on futures markets, has also risen. These factors and South Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country, underline the firmer sentiment, it said. However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90 tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986. REUTER 

The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it could put together an application for control that met the agency's procedural requirements. The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application. It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would have on TWA's bid to take over USAir. In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and said it would file more material on the morning of March 9. But the DOT said it would not wait. "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order issued late Friday. "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added. "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our procedural rules," the DOT said. The agency added that it would continue to consider a separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir stock through a voting trust. USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing did not meet DOT requirements. Reuter 

A high level U.S. trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products. Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against U.S. exports, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied, "That would be the height of foolishness." In addition, he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17. Japan's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986. President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress. "I think it's about time," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session, "It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing." Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday's U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts. Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts. Last year, Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products. Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987. "It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised. I hope it will persuade them we're serious," Smart said of the White House trade sanctions. The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers. "All we ask is a chance. We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be," he said. Measured per car, each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts, Smart said. Reuter 

"Endaka," the strong yen, has usurped "Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster" as Japan's favourite horror story. The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon, the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs a month. But "endaka," like many Japanese products, is for foreign consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said. "It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention to the cost of living," said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo. Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by "chatting" 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month. She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day. "For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso soup, rice and tea," although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner. No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes. The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets. "You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down. It's not reasonable," said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo. Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day. While the businessmen have little choice but to come here, many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia. The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates "endaka" caused an 11.5 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year. Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by curtailing shopping, it said. To help combat "endaka" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet, "Economical Travel in Japan." It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public baths while getting a "revealing glimpse of Japanese in their daily lives." Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice. For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated, berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese "flop house." Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for work. "Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll splurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited pizza for at least two hours." Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. "I had to spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat," he said. REUTER 

California Microwave Inc said it will take non-recurring charges of 9.7 mln dlrs to pre-tax earnings in the third quarter ended March 31. The company said earnings from operations in the second half, ending June 30, 1987, excluding the charges, are expected to be in the break-even range. In the second half of 1986 net earnings were 2,297,000 dlrs, or 29 cts per share. The company said the charges relate to its telecommunications products area and three other areas. California Microwave previously estimated the write-downs in the six to eight-mln-dlr range. It said it will add to that a reserve for investment losses in Argo Communications Corp. Also to be included in the write-down are charges against its advances to an Arizona-based communications electronics firm the company has an option to acquire, it said. In addition, accruals are being made for costs associated with the company's reduction in its Sunnyvale work force. California Microwave said the write-downs should have a nominal cash impact, as the company already has paid for the assets being written down. Reuter 

The European Community (EC) has warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners. The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters. Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry. But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices. Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved. He said "If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory, then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners." Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws, saying "in the last resort, any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest." Otherwise, he said, "the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States." Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims. Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms. "Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system," he said. House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan. There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment. Reuter 

Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels. In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris that "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects." But he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation, "We have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges." Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments. He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention" would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures, he said. Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive. Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months. But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance U.S. competitiveness. He also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate. Reuter 

Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he was maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in retail prices for February. He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between 0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct. He said he was happy with "a good result" for February but stressed a need for continued "vigilance" against inflation. A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year differential between French and lower West German inflation rates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January. If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential came to 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding "The tendency is therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main trading partner."

Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States. "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices," he said in an interview. Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices. "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms." "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?" he said. The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it. Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said. "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered," he said. Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels. Reuter 

Italy is to modify restrictions limiting the amount of lira cash that can be brought in and out of the country, the Foreign Trade Ministry said. A statement said Foreign Trade Minister Rino Formica has signed a measure lifting currency regulations that currently impose a 400,000 lire limit on the value of lira bank notes that can be brought into Italy. It did not say when the new measure would come into force. In future, there will be no limit to the amount of lira bank notes both residents and non-residents can bring into Italy. The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made appropriate declarations at customs points. It said the lifting of the restrictions "reinforces the international status of the lira and meets the requirements expressed several times by foreign exchange dealers." REUTER 

The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a bank spokesman said. "We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four, worth eight mln dlrs," the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out. The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28. It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to determine the kwacha's exchange rate. Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange. The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct. REUTER 

The Surinam Aluminum Company (SURALCO) registered a 75 pct drop in alumina exports in February after its operations were shut down by worker violence and guerrilla sabotage, the official Surinam News Agency, SNA, reported. SNA said Suralco's alumina exports dropped to 23,869 tonnes in February from 92,852 tonnes in January. Aluminum exports, meanwhile, decreased nine pct in the same period, to 1,511 tonnes from 1,647 tonnes. Suralco's alumina refinery at Paranam, 18 miles south of the capital, was shut down February 2 after workers destroyed plant and computer equipment in a protest over layoffs at the company's nearby aluminum smelter. The smelter was shut down January 26 after anti-government guerrillas dynamited two electricity towers which transmit power to the plant from the Afobaka dam. The alumina refinery, owned jointly by Suralco and Billiton NV, a Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary, was reopened March 9.

Banks in Hong Kong are likely to raise prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday, dealers said. They told Reuters local banks may decide on the increase at this weekend's routine meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks. G.C. Goh, chief dealer of the Standard Chartered Bank, said prime rate increases by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 may prompt Hong Kong banks to follow suit. Goh said local banks want to restore the prime to 6-1/2 pct, the level at beginning of 1987. The banks raised the prime to the current six pct from five pct on February 28 after cutting it 1-1/2 points from 6-1/2 on January 15 in response to upside pressure on the Hong Kong dollar, he said. The medium and longer term interbank rates firmed today, with three months ending at 5-1/16 to 4-7/8 pct against yesterday's five to 4-13/16 close.

South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt. He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position. He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt. Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs. Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs. About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan. Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen.

Calls for a cut in Austrian interest rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue. Karl Vak, General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank, Wien, called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board. But Hannes Androsch, head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers. Vak told a news conference that last January's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient. The January cut followed the National Bank's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move. Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct. Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs, head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG, said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point, or even half a point if German rates dropped further. Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct. A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop, he said. Karl Pale, head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [GIRV.VI] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment. Interest margins were too small, particularly when compared with other West European countries. But Hans Haumer, head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first. Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt, Austria's biggest bank. REUTER 

Continental Illinois Corp's <CIL> Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six months. Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks are under way. "I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer, for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's debt," Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing. "I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just how long the run is is anybody's guess," Swearingen said. Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year. The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago, Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an inquiry. Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use. Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for 1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses. Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions. In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share. The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC, during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the 1984 restructuring agreement with the government. The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987, Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans. In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S. Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it bought three small suburban banks. Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks. He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who will eventually own the firm because it still holds the equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln. The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984 bailout of the bank. Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not comment on a successor. The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country doesn't need external sources of cash.

Indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency. "If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments," he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan. Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit. Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries, which are centered in Sumatra. "I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number," he said, according to the agency.

The central bank made outright purchases of bank bills comprising 347 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct, 207 mln stg in band two at 9-13/16 pct and 135 mln stg in band three at 9-3/4 pct. REUTER 

Forstmann Little and Co said Lear Siegler Holding Corp plans to divest its aerospace group subsidiary, comprised of the Defense Electronics Group and the Components Group. Divestitures had been expected since Lear-Siegler, a diversified conglomerate, was acquired last December in a 2.1- billion-dlr-leveraged buyout by the Wall Street firm of Forstmann Little. Lear's aerospace group revenues for fiscal 1987 are expected to be about 700 mln dlrs, said Forstmann. The Defense Electronics Group designs and manufactures weapons, management systems, flight control systems, remotely piloted vehicles and reference and navigation systems, mainly for military markets. The Defense Group subsidiaries are Astronics Corp, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and employs 1,076 people; Instrument and Avionic Systems Corp, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., and employs 3,479 people; International Corp, based in Stamford, Conn., and employs 266 people; and Development Sciences Corp, based in Ontario, Calif., and employs 237 people. The Components Group manufactures pumps, bearings, and other industrial components as well as nuclear control drive rod mechanisms and valves. The Group's subsidiaries include Power Equipment Corp, based in Cleveland, which employs 880 people; Energy Products Corp, based in Santa Ana, Calif., which employs 755 people; Romek Corp, based in Elyria, Ohio, which employs 262 people; and Transport Dynamics in Santa Ana, which employs 254 people. Overall, Lear's Aerospace Group's eight subsidiaries employs 7,200 people. Lear Siegler said it plans to retain Management Services Corp, engaged in aircraft maintenance modification for various Department of Defense agencies. Morgan Stanley and Co will act as financial advsiors for the group's divestitures. Last month, Lear Siegler said it planned to sell its Smith and Wesson handgun business, Starcraft Recreational Products Ltd, the Peerless truck trailer operations, and other units, as part of its restructuring plans. Lear apparently will retain its Piper Aircraft unit. Reuter 

The Senate voted to condemn the proposed European common market tax on vegetable and marine fats and oils and said it would result in retaliation. The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote. "The administration should communicate to the European Community the message that the United States will view the establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated. The resolution said the European Community Commission has proposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish oils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices for the 1987/1988 EC marketing year. The Senate said the tax would amount to almost 90 pct of the current price of soyoil and "have a restrictive effect" on U.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC. It would be "blatantly inconsistent" with obligations of the EC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, the resolution said, and "constitute another egregious attempt" to impose EC agricultural costs on trading partners.

A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd's announcement that it had terminated an agreement in principle to sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd. Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the venture made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time soon. The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security grounds. Commerce chief spokesman B.J. Cooper said the department had had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal. A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unaware of Schlumberger's announcement and would have no immediate reaction. Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had joined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have left the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources for vital equipment used in high-technology weapons. Administration opposition to the deal also stemmed from ongoing trade tensions between the United States and Japan, officials said. Reuter 

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year. "It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it," Lyng said in an interview with Reuters. "It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing," he said. However, Lyng said he did not want to make a "definitive commitment one way or another at this point." Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat. Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn. Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow would buy this year. "I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets," he said. "I have no knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the Soviets have any knowledge." Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last month because "they needed it and because the price was right." "Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think they've always found that our corn was good," he said. Reuter 

The worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. "The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year," said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido. Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed. "It (the bottom) is in the offing," he said. But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct, from two pct in the current year, he said. Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing. The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward the end of last year. Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks, several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery. Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3 pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end. And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said. Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels. The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market. "The important thing is the exchange rate," Taketomi said. If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs of that yet, economists said. A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to recover, economists said. Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd. The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter, 1986. Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct. But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity. To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong. The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986, the official said. Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986. Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses, they said. As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold, the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted, economists said. Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good. The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected, while that of the external sector was better. REUTER 

General Cinema Corp said it expects flat net income for fiscal 1987 ending Oct. 31 against 125.8 mln dlrs or 3.43 dlrs a share a year ago. The company said the costs of a restructuring at its Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc unit and the previous purchase of an 8.5 pct stake in <Cadbury Schweppes PLC> will lead to the flat net figure. It also said it may raise its stake in Cadbury Schweppes to 25 pct, but has not made any additional stock purchases so far. According to the restructuring, Carter Hawley plans to spin-off its specialty stores, including Neiman-Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Contempo Casuals, into a new company named <Neiman-Marcus Group>, whose shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange, it said. As previously announced, General Cinema will own 60 pct of the equity and 40 pct of the voting shares in the new company. The restructuring is subject to approval by Carter Hawley shareholders.

Unemployment in the U.K. Fell a provisional seasonally-adjusted 44,100 in February, to total 3.07 mln or 11.1 pct of the workforce, the Employment Department said. In January, seasonally adjusted unemployment fell by a revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January position was reported as flat. The unadjusted jobless total, including school leavers, fell to 3.23 mln, or 11.7 pct, from 3.30 mln, 11.9 pct, in January. February was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted unemployment registered a fall. It was at a peak of 11.7 pct last summer. Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about 20,000, will continue. A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and continued the downward trend seen in the past six months. He said the February fall was spread throughout the country and among men and women. REUTER 

The company said layoffs will start within the next few weeks. Goodrich said it will continue to make chemicals and adhesives in Akron, employing about 356. Another 5000 salaried employees in Akron work for Goodrich. The company said it has not been able to operate the businesses being discontinued in Akron profitably enough to justify the large investment that it has in them. Goodrich said it will continue to make aircraft tires at Norwood, N.C., and sonar domes at Jacksonville, Fla., and will relocate its molded rubber products business to a site not yet chosen. It said it will stop making insulators for missiles. Goodrich said it is prepared to discuss with officials of the United Rubber Workers Union severance benefits for affected employees and issues related to the continued operation in Akron of the chemical and adhesives businesses and to the phaseout of the Akron aircraft tire, missile and marine and molded rubber products manufacturing. A company spokesman said it does not expect any adverse impact on earnings from the move. Reuter 

Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares. Reuter 

More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities, according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates. Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said. The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "zero certificate case," where no certificate program was assumed, and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings. The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct. Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct. For the five-year period examined, government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case. The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs. The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined. The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash.

Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said. They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant. Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg. Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading. Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year. But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt. Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates. "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget." Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time. The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term. Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again. "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long." Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks." Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate. Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately. Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets. With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

The net inflow of foreign investment into Australia jumped to 7.3 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 from 4.32 billion in the third quarter and 4.55 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said. The Bureau attributed the increase to a turnaround of 2.08 billion dlrs in official sector transactions and a 1.09 billion turnaround in direct investment. The turnaround in official transactions to a 1.52 billion inflow from a 555 mln outflow in the third quarter, against a 520 mln inflow a year earlier, was largely on account of government foreign currency borrowings, it said. Direct investment recorded a turnaround to a 1.04 billion dlr inflow in the fourth quarter from a 57 mln withdrawal in the third quarter, against a 546 mln inflow in the fourth quarter of 1985, the Bureau said. It said the major part of the turnaround reflected an injection of funds, estimated at around 700 mln dlrs, associated with the previously reported restructuring of the Australian operations of General Motors Corp <GM>. GM used the funds to pay out or take over certain Australian liabilities of its local unit <General Motors-Holden's Ltd>, it said. However, net borrowings remained the major part of total inflow, accounting for 6.16 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter against 3.88 billion in the third quarter and 4.03 billion a year earlier, the Bureau said. Net official borrowings comprised 1.52 billion dlrs against a net outflow of 548 mln in the third quarter and a 516 mln inflow a year earlier. Total private and semi-public authority net borrowings rose to 4.64 billion dlrs from 4.42 billion in the third quarter and 3.51 billion a year earlier. REUTER 

New orders for durable goods received by U.S. manufacturers rose 5.7 billion dlrs, or 6.0 pct, in February to 101.2 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said. Excluding defense, orders rose 3.8 pct, compared with a revised January decline of 7.7 pct. In January, durable goods fell a revised 9.9 pct instead of the previously reported 7.5 pct. Durables excluding defense were reported originally as having fallen 9.9 pct in January. The Commerce Department on Monday revised orders statistics for 1982 to 1986 to reflect more current inventory valuation methods, and the February orders statistics are consistent with the revisions, officials said. The February order increase was led by transportation equipment, up 11.1 pct after an 18.0 pct decline in January. Orders for defense capital goods rose 48.9 pct to 6.9 billion dlrs, following a 38.8 pct decline in January. Non-defense capital goods orders fell 1.6 pct in February to 26.3 billion dlrs after falling 8.7 pct in January, the department said. Electrical machinery orders rose in February by 8.2 pct to 17.2 billion dlrs after falling 15.4 pct in January. Primary metals orders were up 13.9 pct to 8.4 billion dlrs after a 20 pct decline in January, the department said.

Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive." European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said. At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month's meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate." The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non- members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer. Reuter 

The latest requests for the maize were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20 Ecu daily rebate. The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries, in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent dispute over grain sales to Spain. If the latest French requests are accepted as expected, this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25,500 tonnes. The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries. Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference. Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down. Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987. U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said. A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price. Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said. In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct. Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said.

Most major U.S. banks today matched Tuesday's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, the first prime rate boosts since mid-1984. Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and funding costs as justification. Analysts said the prime rate rises may have been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhance profit margins given problems with developing country loans. Commenting on the prime rate increases, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committee that "I hope it was a temporary blip upward." Among the major banks which today announced prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank, Continental Illinois National Bank, Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Irving Trust, Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, Marine Midland, and Security Pacific National Bank. Other banking companies announcing prime rate rises included Pittsburgh National Bank, Texas Commerce Bank-Houston, Provident National Bank, First National Bank of Boston, Florida Federal Savings and Loan Association, and SunTrust Banks.

Heinz Co is "within sight of our 22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" for the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts. O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said the food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-year history." Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55 cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier. O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big brands, new products and services, new geography, internal growth and acquisitions. He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive said a volume falloff in the overall product category "is a concern to us." O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln dlrs. O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which produces dry baby food cereal. He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating its first substantial dividends," and implementation of a new partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul, South Korea. To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz implemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted at manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement. He said a modernization program is in effect at the company's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force, trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced to 2,500 in 1988.

India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). "The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports," a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. "MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India," a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. "We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India," the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. "We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest," he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. "It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced," one trade source said. "The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants." Another added, "Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. "This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy." REUTER 

Defence electronics manufacturer Ferranti Plc <FNTI.L> and shipping and property group Trafalgar House Plc <THSL.L> both pulled out of the bidding shortly before last month's deadline. Royal Ordnance made pre-tax profits of 26 mln stg on sales of 487 mln stg in calendar 1985, its first full year of commercial operation.

Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986. Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30. Reuter 

Thailand's main paddy crop is expected to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35 mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said. It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986. It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago. The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddy output. REUTER 

Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said. He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year. This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful," he said. Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. "We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years," he added. His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit," he said. Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained. "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered. "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said. He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.

With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year's level of 85 pct. Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program. The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30. USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said. USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official told Reuters. A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said. "A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn't look very likely now," he said. To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program. Reuter 

Newmont Mining Corp said it completed the previously announced reduction of its share in <Peabody Holding Co Inc> to 49.97 pct from 61.47 pct. Newmont realized 116.8 mln dlrs in the transaction. For 1986, Newmont reported net income of 74.2 mln dlrs. Peabody, the largest coal producer in the U.S., had net income of 100.8 mln dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion dlrs in 1986. Newmont doubled its ownership in Peabody in January by purchasing 30.74 pct interest held by the Williams Cos for 320 mln dlrs. The reduction resulted from completion of an earlier announced agreement by Peabody to sell a 15.01 pct interest in the company to Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates in exchange for all the coal properties owned by Eastern.

Missouri Republican Senators John Danforth and Christopher Bond have introduced a bill that would allow wheat and feedgrain producers along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers hurt by flooding last year to collect at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments this year without planting. Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to a provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by the House tomorrow.

January wheat exports comprised 251,000 tonnes to European Community destinations and 284,000 tonnes to third countries. The Soviet Union was prominent in third country destinations, taking 167,700 tonnes while Poland was credited with 54,500 and South Korea 50,000 tonnes. Italy was the largest EC recipient with 75,000 tonnes followed by West Germany with 55,200 and France 52,000 tonnes.

Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit." He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth," he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful," he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues," he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot.

OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said. He told a news conference here "After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices." Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned. "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said. Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva. The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs. Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level. "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman said. He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd. Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said. "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs," the group's president said. He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely. "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to," he said. Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials." Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude. "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year," Lukman said. The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market. "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said. Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.

OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters. Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance." He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through. Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that." "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they'll help each other," he said. Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.

Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research Institute told Reuters. Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing. About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC 103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora. Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said. Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees. De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986 that it became widespread. The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be sprayed and remain under observation. T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before late May when the monsoon rains begin. De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC 106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned. The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN 2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058. Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102. These six varieties would also be used to replace trees uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said. Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge. "But no compensation is contemplated at the moment," he added. De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the spread of the disease. "The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably helped in some way because trees have not been affected in areas that are dry," he said. Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it has not caused a drop in production. Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction last week firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at the previous sale. REUTER 

Treasury Secretary James Baker said the United States and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month. "Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions," Baker told a Senate committee. Baker continued, "We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels." He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters. Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar. "I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements," Baker said. Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world's economy. He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth. Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final. Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation. Reuter 

The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said "had a very serious impact on Venezuela." PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said. Reuter 

Iomega Corp said it has laid off over a quarter of its professional and management staff and nearly half of its direct labor force as part of a restructuring and downsizing of its business. The company also said it will receive a qualified opinion from the auditors of it 1986 financial statement subject to the outcome of two suits. The company is a defendant in a consolidated class action law suit which seeks damages in an unspecified amount and is also a defendant in a related shareholder action. Iomega said the auditors state in their opinion letter that both actions are in the early stages of discovery and the likely outcome can not be determined at this time. The company said a corporate wide reduction of its professional, management and indirect labor will result in the permanent elimination of 183 positions in all functional areas of the company's business. This represents over 25 pct of professional, management and indirect employees, it added. In addition, Iomega announced layoff of about 182 employees, principally from its manufacturing direct labor force. Those affected represent about 46 pct of direct labor. Commenting on the layoffs, Iomega said those from among the direct labor force affects personnel building the Alpha Eight Inch Disk Drive and Bernoulli Boxes. "This action is required as we bring our finished goods inventory and inventory in our distribution channels down to acceptable levels," it explained. The company stated this layoff does not affect the production of its new 5-1/4 inch Beta 20 product which is currently being built to a backlog of orders. Reuter 

Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a national safe drug use program. The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee. The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC. "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV oversight committee said. In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program. The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan. "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect," Wehler said.

The threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin. But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip, or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a "bear" market. "It's the billion dollar question," said Richard O'Brien, economist at American Express International Bank in London. Japan's trade surplus -- 92.7 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world, and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit. Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods, may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit. And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O'Brien said. The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets. "A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets," said O'Brien. "Now, it is much less certain." Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O'Brien. Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith Barney Harris Upham said "We're still in a bull market," adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and "The bear usually strikes slowly." Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London, said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices. Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market, according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London. He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark. In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets. REUTER 

The company also said its natural gas revenues so far this year have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due to mild weather and soft economic conditions. "But the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made up during the course of the year," Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhile it will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market.

Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived. For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of "mechanically separated pork." Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product. Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said. Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said. USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products. Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment. Reuter 

The Bundesbank came into the domestic money market to add temporary liquidity through federal government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct, dealers said. They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move. It had been 3.80/90 on Friday. The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January. Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients. Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month, with the bulk being paid out next week. In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank. On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0 billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion. The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month. With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary. However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain. The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4 billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said. REUTER 

Surprisingly strong U.S. housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth, economists said. Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom. U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804 mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986. The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764 mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January. "February's weather is usually more adverse for home building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures inflate the statistics. Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month. But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer. "Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'Let's do it now'," said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much of the financing for home building. But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy. He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct. As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1. Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317 mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate. "Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers to start waving "four pct GNP banners" for the first quarter. Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter. But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not convinced that growth will pick up in future. "The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on now, not all of which is intentional," he said. For example, U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks, produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln. Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second, he said. "If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter," agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed. "At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the second," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the sources said. Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPA secretary general D.S.

The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price of 4.15. The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year, compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share. Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares. AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23. <Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed. AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid. AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue. It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL.

Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said. Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57. A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years. Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services. The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg. Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports. The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at." "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients. He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list. REUTER 

The European Community's (EC) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states. Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said. But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's budget. He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. "I hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget," he said. The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said. Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy. The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils. Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax. "What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home," he said. Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other countries. Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said. The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism. In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers. Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission's farm price proposals, he added. Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition. The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices. National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today's vote.

Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review. It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct. The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry. The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review. Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986. Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct. The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters. It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct. Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2 pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986. REUTER 

The Reagan administration has asked Lugar to offer the measure, the aide said. However, a number of farm groups have told Lugar they oppose the proposal on the grounds it would reopen the 1985 farm bill, and the senator has decided to take a second look at the proposal, the aide said.

(Charan Industries Inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting. "We grew basically 100 pct last year, I'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman said. Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985. Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986. Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30. Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada. The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues. Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for <Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear. Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books. The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone. Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs. Reuter 

Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said plans to scrap the country's parallel currency, Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to objections from foreign businessmen and others. But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government still considered FECs unsatisfactory. Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs, Tian said: "We have decided to postpone the question. As to whether it will be done in the future, it will be done according to the evolution of the situation." He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and added: "It is rather complicated." The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and there is a big black market in the currency, though it is theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency, renminbi. Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had "many demerits and negative influences." Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlier this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates would be scrapped this year. Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative. Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar press conference last year that the FECs would be abolished, saying the government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable to have two currencies circulating in China at the same time.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct. However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly. He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don't think we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of "gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy. Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP. Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were "perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain. He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3. Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election." He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls. Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current wave of election fever" in Britain, he added: "It is more likely that there will be an election this year" than not. He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said. The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said. The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 "was the right balance, economically and politically," he said. Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move. But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate. Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg. Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said. But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added. Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain. He said conditions created by London's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries. Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said. First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets. He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party. Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record of low inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany. Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo. REUTER 

Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters. Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions. "There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said. Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months. "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all." "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month," Schoufour said. The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year. Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy. Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest. Reuter 

The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be enough to buy the company, analysts said. Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said uncertainty surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to Gencorp broadcasting licenses. Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading. "The expectation is either there will be someone else or the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's cooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton group. Analysts said there is concern about challenges to Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years, were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments and political contributions. "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation," said Baker of the offer. Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time for any transaction. A source close to General Partners, however, said General Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations. The source said if approved, the authority would allow a transaction to be carried out. If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partners would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting properties until the licensing situation is resolved. General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc. Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell the stations. GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV. Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a group that challenged the station's license. GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs. General Partners said it intends to keep the company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and related products segment. Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting, including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per share, he said. The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling business might also be worth several dollars per share, he said. Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp, founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve. "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal with the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said. Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but they declined to predict what steps the company might take. They said it would be possible the company might consider a leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer. General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock. "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing surprises me anymore," said Rose. GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers. Reuter 

Combustion Engineering Inc said it expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the year-ago 13.6 mln dlrs, mainly due to financing costs resulting from the January 1987 acquisition of AccuRay Corp. The company said it has filed for an offering of four mln common shares and 150 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 2017, with proceeds to be used to refinance the short-term bank debt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance other costs of the transaction and for general corporate purposes. Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S. and the remainder overseas. Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker of computer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp and paper mills. The company said it expects to release first quarter results in the third week in April. Combustion said it expects further restructuring of core businesses -- particularly Lummus Crest -- this year through staff reductions downsizings and the consolidation of facilities. Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year losses in the Engineering and Construction segment. But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be approximately offset by a number of factors, including a somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation segment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay technology and operations and delays in waste to energy projects.

The grain output of a major Chinese grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain, the province's vice-governor said. The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui, as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall. Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978. He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats. He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports. The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct. "With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production," he said. On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the northeast, but it imports wheat. "Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered adequate," Tian said. REUTER 

Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said. They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops. The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting. Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production. The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production. The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week. The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86. The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season. Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. Reuter 

The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change. Reuter 

The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said. Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week. However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added. Reuter 

Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has agreed to take over the outstanding 25 pct in <Deutsche Bank (Asia) AG>, the former <European Asian Bank AG>, from Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference. Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with Creditanstalt. Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of Lloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said. Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent capital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell. <Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was acquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would be consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said. Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the balance sheet section "participations," Christians said. But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active participation. Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations. Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in a separate holding company. Reuter 

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold, economists said. "There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about," added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc. Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods. Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln. Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount window for the third week running, with the latest week's borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks. While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks. The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements. "Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure," said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April. "The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc, who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April. Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates. M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine, compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth. "The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March," said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges. In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath. Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here. "Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else," said Salomon's di Clemente, adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy's health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary to di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first. Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February's U.S. trade data are due for release. Reuter 

U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20 to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from 6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd, up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said. In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8 pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said. Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said. So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31 mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said. Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.41 mln bpd, off 7.7 pct from 9.11 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.96 mln bpd, up 28.1 pct from 3.09 mln, it said. Reuter 

Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds." Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point. During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for." He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct. Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.

Indonesia has imported palm oil this year and is likely to take more, trade sources said. They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a Ministry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued licences to import the commodity. He also said there was no sign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia. A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil to Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this month and other vessels had been earmarked for April. Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages. Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low. They said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and RBD oil. Last week there were rumours in European markets that Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian Ministry of Trade official said this was incorrect. Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said they could include those issued earlier this year and applications not yet granted. Reuter 

Comalco Ltd said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final dividend, delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continues to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Comalco's Commonwealth Aluminium Corp unit said earlier it has conditionally agreed to sell its Goldendale smelter in Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to Columbia Aluminium Corp. Comalco said its extraordinary provision of 27.3 mln dlrs costs for Goldendale losses and closure may be reduced if the sales agreement were completed. REUTER 

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this year, Lawson said. "As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year," he added. Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0 billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg. On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal 1987/88. No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 aggregate, he said. "But broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament. Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular." On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position." Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future. "We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0 pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead," Lawson said. "Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course remains a major objective of government policy." "But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future." Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange Control Act from the Statute book. On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be charged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate." He said that under the new proposed system, companies should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments against tax on capital gains. "Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in 1988/89," Lawson said. Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation tax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due." "I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and File." This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax collection, and would not come into force until the early 1990s. Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those new fields exceeds the costs incurred. Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any particular field. On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive tax relief for retraining workers. Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax on the basis of cash paid and received. Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds are to be raised to 21,300 stg. New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added. The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be set at 125,000 stg. Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment. The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuine trading companies" will not be affected. He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from April 1. "In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said. The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct. Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decision to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget." Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to 27 pct, he said. On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable provisions made by financial traders. The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said. "The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year," Lawson said. MORE 

Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said. Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc. High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said. Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package. Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros. They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another. The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank. "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community," one banker said. Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for Brazil's debt stance.

Taiwan's balance of payments surplus widened to a record 16.62 billion U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1986 from 9.35 billion in 1985, the central bank said.

Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat. An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers. Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said. If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said. English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear. Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said. Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains. An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops. Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said. Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program.

Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino, president of the government's state company holding firm, the national development council (conade). He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all or part of the companies. Independent economists warn that the deficit could push inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the govenment target of 40-50 pct. Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits. Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold, including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock exchange. Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern state of arequipa. Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries said they were out of their offices. Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima stock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be sold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase stock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru. He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad until at least july 1988. Reuter 

France's Economic and Social Council (CES), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French economy, said the country's annual growth may not reach two pct in 1987. French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any specific forecasts. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be about two pct. Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les Echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about the same as last year due to a less favourable international environment. CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation. Disinflation was an absolute priority, Neeser told journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for many years. Reuter 

Taiwan is expected to boost agricultural imports from the U.S. And Europe in calendar 1987 to help balance trade, the Council of Agriculture said. A council official, who declined to be named, told Reuters the imports, which will include about seven mln tonnes of oilseeds, grains and dairy products, would be worth some four billion U.S. Dlrs against 3.72 billion in 1986 and 3.38 billion in 1985. Taiwan's surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, government figures show. Government figures also show Taiwan's surplus with Europe rose to 1.53 billion dlrs last year from 543 mln in 1985. Taiwan's imports of U.S. Farm produce last year amounted to 1.41 billion dlrs against 1.52 billion in 1985. Imports from Europe rose to 182 mln U.S. Dlrs from 148 mln, the official said. He attributed the decline in the value of U.S. Imports to falling agricultural products prices last year. REUTER 

President Leon Febres Cordero said Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments. Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt. "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain." Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said. He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake, which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited. Reuter 

Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects a difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief executive Werner Dieter told a news conference. Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer nations. Domestic business was also declining and orders for West German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986, Dieter said. Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986. Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started last year, were now having an effect. Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims." He said the company's drive to combine activities in mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus point" for Mannesmann. Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks. It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar and lack of demand for steel pipe. Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this year. REUTER 

A 0/92 program would have very little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the Agriculture Department. The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said. The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested. "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small," the report said. "The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage," the USDA report said. The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production/high risk areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins, director of USDA's economics analysis staff. "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation," Collins said. USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton. Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of cotton, the report said. "In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered," according to the analysis. "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said. For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more attractive. Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program. "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments," Collins said. In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month.

Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. Reuter 

Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L> which earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over 1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting. The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc <DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most profitable retailing group in the U.K. It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses. Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger talks with the high street pharmacist <Underwoods Plc> had been called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended offer for <Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>. The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of 45.5 mln making it the largest single component. The company said that the improvement had been achieved by substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins. In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln. The company said its property operations would increase substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with developers <Rosehaugh Plc>. The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge. The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts. As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT. Reuter 

U.S. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year. "I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening. Politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to a senior farm-state senator said. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs. "I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this," American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said. Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive. His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the the administration's position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers' income. Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly. "There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz proposal," said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee. "Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan," O'Conner said. Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or 4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said. Reuter 
